They managed to score 2 in the bottom of the 9th, but Miguel Olivo's flyout to right to end the game was just too short. We sat in the right field seats for the first time."

I don't remember the game being super interesting from a neutral fan perspective; it was mostly about seeing Wrigley Field for the first time. The park had interesting scoreboards under the upper deck, so you could see them if you were sitting in the far back rows of the main level. Also, unlike every other park I've visited to date, you couldn't walk all the way around the stadium without temporarily leaving the stadium. The main concourse, which involved all seating in foul territory, was separated from the outfield bleachers."

This park reminded me of Safeco Field (now T-Mobile Park) in that the upper deck had a very similar feel. The concourse was also kinda similar if I remember correctly.\nSimilar to Wrigley, this park had some slightly outdated elements including a couple large dot-matrix scoreboards. Safeco Field had a smaller one up through 2012, but each one the White Sox had was bigger on its own than the one the Mariners had. The video scoreboard was also much smaller than the one in Seattle, and pretty low-res. Like Wrigley, it gave a retro vibe to the experience, but from a different era; Wrigley was more like the 1950s or 60s, with U.S. Cellular more like 80s and 90s with the dot-matrix scoreboards; I liked it. I took a walk around the main concourse, which was neat. It was later in the game, so it was dark and cool, one of my favorite parts of baseball games; when it has cooled down and the lights are taking full effect. I also liked the pseudo wall that surrounds the concourse. The White Sox launch fireworks after each home run, which I thought was neat. The Mariners had not started doing that at this point.\n The Royals were in the wild card hunt at this point, and ended up securing their spot I think the next night. The White Sox were stuck in their phase of mediocrity, which they wouldn't really leave until late 2016 and 2017 when the rebuild was a full go. While U.S. Cellular/Guaranteed Rate Field is not rated very highly, I enjoyed my time there and would like to revisit, which shouldn't be too hard since I'm already planning on revisiting Wrigley."

However, at this point in the season, Trevor Rosenthal was still their closer, despite pitching quite poorly to that point. I was optimistic the Mariners could score off him, and they certainly did that, with an Adam Lind walk-off 3-run home run. A really exciting end to the game, after it honestly being quite boring to that point."

He started the 8th inning, but the wheels fell off and the Mariners took advantage. Mike Zunino led off the inning with a home run. Guillermo Heredia, recent Triple-A callup, got his first major-league hit and RBI to get the Mariners their second run. Then a few hitters later, Robinson Cano hit a 3 run BOMB to our section in right field to give the Mariners a 5-4 lead. In fact, if you look at video of the home run he hit, you can see my dad and I in the frame! \nThis dramatic comeback was followed with Edwin Diaz, young flamethrower getting his first career save after being given the closers job starting that evening. Weirdly enough, the winning pitcher in this game, reliever Donn Roach, also won the walk-off game in June. These were the only two wins Roach got that year, and he only pitched in 4 games with the Mariners. Easily the best game I had been to at this point in the season."

		"notes": "This was the fourth stadium I'd visited. I didn't have super high expectations or anything, but this is a fantastic ballpark. While being one of the newest parks in MLB, it manages to have an old-school intimate feel. This is probably because the ballpark was built in a very tiny footprint. Despite that, the park had incredibly wide concourses, wide enough to have separate smaller kiosks (unlike T-Mobile Park, for example). \nThe upper deck is what I've started referring to as a \"split-level\", in that the sight lines from the concourse of the field are almost uninterrupted throughout. This is different from T-Mobile Park for example, where the only sight lines onto the field involve looking through the tunnel, and even those aren't great. Hopefully I'm explaining this well. Either way, it's a great feature to have, as it makes being in the upper deck much more palatable, and makes you feel closer to the action. Our seats were in the main level, which is also somewhat split, as there's a walkway between the closer and farther away sections. The seats were very good, although we totally forgot about sunscreen, and got very sunburned on our legs in the 90-degree Minnesota heat.\nThe game itself was pretty interesting, since the Royals' center fielder Paulo Orlando ended up a triple short of the cycle. This was also during Twins' second baseman Brian Dozier's incredible 2016 second half, and he hit one of his 28 post All-Star Break home runs. He ended up hitting 42 for the season, setting a new record for a second baseman in the American League. \nWhile as a neutral fan, I wanted to see the Twins win (as the home team), this was still a great experience, despite the sunburns."

		"notes": "Wow, this one was probably the most interesting game I'd been to, yet most of the interesting stuff happened after we left. First of all, there was a portable National Baseball Hall of Fame exhibit setup, so we spent some time there. We got done there early, and for some reason the gates at Kauffman Stadium don't open until an hour and a half or so before first pitch, which is much later than other parks I've been to; the norm is usually 2 hours. We were waiting in the muggy mid-August heat, though we did know that thunderstorms were in the forecast and were almost certainly going to cause a rain delay.\nFirst of all, the ballpark. Kauffman Stadium is extremely unique, in that it was built in a time of multipurpose stadiums galore. Virtually every other team was building a multipurpose stadium in the 60s and 70s, and the baseball-only stadium didn't come back into vogue until the early 90s with the opening of Camden Yards in Baltimore. It did feel a bit old, but that was probably because I had come from a stadium almost 40 years newer in Target Field. The park only has an upper deck in the foul area, so the outfield seating is just a lower deck and a concourse, though there are the recognizable fountains. The scoreboard is really cool, as it's in the shape of a crown yet still captures all the necessary information. The staff seemed really nice, there were at least a few ushers who said \"Hello and welcome to The K!\"\nThe beginning of the game was rather unassuming. Brian Dozier hit another home run, which was neat. However, at around the bottom of the 4th inning we knew it was only a matter of time until the storm came. The Royals were leading 4-1 at that point. If they could complete the top of the 5th inning with a lead, they would win the game if they couldn't resume the game that night. However, the Twins tied the game at 4, and almost directly after, the game entered a rain delay. Fans stormed out of the stadium, including my dad and I, since we had an early flight the next morning and couldn't stick around. Getting out was a little bit of a nightmare, since everyone was trying to leave at once. One car in front of us even hit another car, and stopped one of the two outgoing lanes of traffic. This ended our experience there, but the game itself still had a lot left.\nDuring the rain delay, some young kids started running around the concourse, just as a way to entertain themselves, and this got on the broadcast. Eventually, the game did resume. However, there was ANOTHER delay, this time because half the lights in the stadium went out! That's not something you see at all. After that delay was done, they played on. The game even went extra innings, and the Royals walked it off in the bottom of the 11th inning. The game ended at 2:15 AM. With us getting up around 4 to leave, it was a good idea that we didn't stick around.\nIn summary, a very interesting and very weird game. I'd really like to go back to Kauffman, so I can get a full game experience, because it was a nice park and I wanted to be there longer."

While I was hoping for that, the Mariners would settle for a double, which scored pinch-runner Tyler Smith from second.

While the Mariners were basically eliminated from the postseason race at this point, I was still excited for this game as it was my first time going to Fan Appreciation Night, which is always the last Friday game of the year.\nThe Indians were pretty fresh off their modern record 22-game win streak, and so this was a tall task for the Mariners. However, Erasmo Ramirez of all people rose to the occasion, throwing 8 innings of 1-run ball, one of the best outings from a Mariner starting pitcher in months. Knowing that the Mariners had the top of the lineup coming to the plate in the bottom of the 9th, I was confident they'd win the game, and they did! Nelson Cruz hit a walk-off 2-run home run off Cleveland closer Cody Allen. A good win for the Mariners."

This was our 2nd Opening Day, which in my opinion is always more exciting than just a home opener. The Mariners faced the Indians again, and though slightly controversially, Felix Hernandez was given the ball. At this point James Paxton was clearly the better pitcher, though he didn't start Opening Day, and never would in a Mariners uniform.\nFelix pitched pretty well, allowing no runs over 5.1 innings, his 2nd shortest Opening Day start; his shortest was the year prior in Houston, going only 5 innings. The Mariners were facing reigning Cy Young winner Corey Kluber, who gave up 2 runs in the first inning, and somehow that's all the Mariners would need, despite Kluber throwing an 8-inning complete game! A good Opening Day win for the Mariners."

The Mariners continued to see Angels starter Andrew Heaney well, as both Cruz and Ryon Healy tagged him in the bottom of the 4th to end his night. While Trout did hit a second home run, that wasn't enough as the Mariners held on and won 5-3. This actually put the Mariners up half a game above the Astros in the division standings, but that didn't last too long. A good win for the Mariners."

Marco Gonzales threw an absolute gem, and was a strike away from a shutout after going 1-2 to Mike Moustakas before giving up an RBI single. He got the next hitter out and finished the game for his first MLB complete game. All around a great game for the Mariners."

The Red Sox became the 4th team I've seen home and away (Cubs, Royals, Twins), a list that still unfortunately excludes the Mariners. \nenway Park was amazing! I currently have it in the S-tier of my ballparks tier list. When I visited, it was my favorite park, but since every trip has resulted in me finding a new favorite, I've decided to use a tier list rather than a numbered list since the best parks are all so close. \nThere was a serious chance that the game would be postponed, as thunderstorms were rampant before the game. The start time was delayed from 7:10 to around 7:45, but the whole game was played with no more delays. There was some rain during the game, but it wasn't bad. \nOur seats were in Loge Box 118, which is basically a regular section cut in half, then cut in half again with a pole separating two rows of 4 seats. You don’t have to climb over as many people to get to your seat, making it very easy to get in and out of your seat during the game. I don’t know how many other teams have this, but I will definitely be on the lookout for box seating like this in future stadiums, and hopefully the Mariners add this someday.\nWe flew in on a red-eye flight the night before, and I was running on about 2 hours of sleep. I was extremely tired in the 5th or 6th inning, and was kept awake by some Pepsi. We left in the middle of the 8th inning, after they played Sweet Caroline, a Fenway Park tradition. As I said before, a fantastic balllpark and a fantastic experience. The only strange thing was that they served hot dogs in bread! Don't know what that was about."

Yankee Stadium II was very generic and uninteresting, and is the first and so far only park I don't have a desire to go back to. Local fans we talked to seem to agree that Fenway Park is superior and the new Yankee Stadium is not as good as the old one, even though the old one wasn't original from 1976-2008.\nWe sat in our seats in right-center field for about 2 innings, then got up and walked around because it was 97 degrees and the heat was unbearable. We walked through Monument Park, which was neat, and we saw the museum with a bunch of the World Series trophies and history, which was also neat. Like Target Field, the upper deck was also a \"split-level\", which was one of the actually good qualities of the park.In my opinion, the architects didn't do a good enough job of copying the design of the old park. My dad said it was almost like an amusement park version, and I'd agree. I'm overall disappointed with the stadium, especially compared to what they were basing it after."

The ball was hit at 107 MPH, and had a 74% hit probability, making what would have been an amazing moment a tough luck out. However, Mallex Smith followed with a base hit to win the game. \nThe game was followed by a Hall of Fame-themed fireworks show celebrating Edgar Martinez's induction to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. We sat in the LF bleachers for the first time since Opening Day 2015, and they now had padded backrests! Before, there were literally just the metal benches to sit on, if I remember correctly.

I went to the game with two friends I had just met, including my friend Andrew. This was obviously our first game together, but would be far from the last. \nDespite going to many home openers and a few Opening Days to this point, this was my first time seeing the final game of the season. After every final home game of the season, the Mariners players stick around and toss out extra giveaways they had, and they did the same here. Unfortunately, we didn't get any. Mariners center fielder Kyle Lewis was taking pictures with fans, and I probably would have gotten one if he had stuck around a few more minutes. \nKyle Seager homered, Kyle Lewis got an RBI. Pretty good way to end the season. This ended up being the last game I went to for 550 days, because of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in no attendance for the entire Mariners 2020 season."

Since that game in 2019 was the day before college classes started, this was the first game I attended while in college! Capacity was limited to 9000 fans for the first two homestands, and this one was reported as a sellout. Masks and social distancing will be a thing. \nMariners were down early, 5-1 after 7 innings. They came back with 6 runs in the bottom of the 8th to take a 7-6 lead, including an error on a throw by Brandon Belt to Brandon Crawford, two guys who have played together forever, to give the Mariners the lead. The Giants came back with a pinch-hit home run by Alex Dickerson in the top of the 9th. Mariners walked it off in the 10th off of 3 straight walks by Jose Alvarez, and due to the runner on 2nd that’s all they needed. The end was very influenced by both the three batter minimum rule and the runner on 2nd in extras rule, probably the most I'd seen of any game since the either rule was instituted. The crowd was great despite capacity limitations, and since everyone was spread out it was plenty loud. Another excellent Opening Day for the Mariners."

Jake Odorizzi had a rough first inning, throwing almost 40 pitches, though only allowed 1 run in that inning. Nick Margevicius pitched well, though had to leave due to arm fatigue in the 5th inning. The bullpen really picked him up, allowing no hits the rest of the game, and Marge only allowed one, resulting in a combined one-hitter! The Mariners broke out the bats in the bottom of the 5th, scoring 4 runs and taking a lead they wouldn’t give back. \nThis was the largest win margin to this point in the season, at 5 runs, and therefore their first “blowout” win by Baseball-Reference’s standards. The weather was super nice, an impossible mid-70s day in April. As a result Andrew and I both got sunburned on our arms. The boos were also VERY loud, since this was the first series the Astros played in Seattle with fans after the 2017 cheating scandal came to light in late 2019/early 2020. Since we sat in the left field bleachers, there was also a lot of heckling aimed at the Astros left fielder, Chas McCormick, despite the fact that he made his MLB debut in 2021 and had nothing to do with the scandal. There was a legendary group of hecklers behind us that were going at it most of the game, and was by far the most heckling I’d ever heard. Overall fantastic experience, though sunscreen is a must for future day Mariners games."

Chris Flexen had a tough outing, but managed to make it through 4 innings giving up only 3 runs. Shohei Ohtani hit a home run, but I missed it because I was looking at my phone unfortunately. \nFor the first inning, I predicted that Trout and Haniger would both homer, Haniger more specifically on the first pitch. He did in fact hit a leadoff home run, first of the year, but it was not off the first pitch. Fortunately Trout did not homer in the first. It was a beautiful night for baseball, if a bit cold later on. There was an annoying heckler who was yelling stuff off and on. \nWith it being the last day of April, in the middle of the 8th inning, they played the song “It’s Gonna Be Me”, but the “me” sounds like “May” so that’s the text that was on the electronic scoreboards. But they didn't stop there, as they played it after the Mariners hitters got on base, scored a couple runs, AND during the pitching change, and it was hilarious. \nMariners bullpen came in clutch once again, as the Angels ceased to score after the 3rd until the 9th inning, where they just got 1 off of Rafael Montero. Struggling hitters Dylan Moore and Tom Murphy both homered and got other RBI hits, which was big for both of them. Overall great game to go to, especially since the Mariners lost big, 10-5 the next night. Andrew wasn’t super jazzed about it, but we still had a fun time."

The concourses were neat, and interestingly enough the bottom ones seemed more updated than the top ones. We went to the 4th deck to get a picture, which was a very cool view. The bleacher area was also really cool, and there were plenty of places to walk around. I got autographs from Manny Mota and Steve Yeager. Yeager mentioned that he played in Seattle in his final year, and told me to enjoy my time in California (spoiler: I did). \nThe food selection was off the charts, and while T-Mobile Park might have more variety, all the options at Dodger Stadium made a lot of sense for baseball. There were BBQs, Dodger Dogs, garlic fries, burgers, ice cream, nachos, street tacos, and more. I went with a Dodger Dog, which were decent, but the fries were good and they had Coke products. Also got the obligatory soft serve helmet cup. Overall probably the best experience I've ever had at a baseball game. Dodger Stadium fits nicely into my S-tier of ballparks, and could easily be my favorite. I'm trying to fight recency bias since it's been 2 years since my visit to Fenway Park.

They had some live music beyond the batters eye in center field, as well as a grass lawn called the “Park at the Park” which looked like a neat hangout space; it was full when we got into the park. \nLike Dodger Stadium, this park had the odds on one side and the evens on the other side, so our section was somewhat easier to find I guess. This new number system is growing on me but still a little weird. I got ice cream here too, though I think the Dodger Stadium stuff was better. They also had Coca-Cola products, and I got another souvenir cup, and remembered it this time (I forgot it at Dodger Stadium!). \ns for the game itself, the Dbacks starter struggled HARD, and was walking everyone. The Padres scored 5 runs in the 2nd, but that was all they’d get for the entire game. The Padres gave it back up, and the go-ahead run was driven in by...the winning pitcher, who was also a reliever!! He also stole 2nd, which added to the weirdness. The first, and probably the last time I’ll see a relief pitcher hit the go-ahead RBI in a game. We sat in the upper deck, which by default were the worst seats we had, but they weren’t bad or anything. Overall good experience, though might not crack the top tier with the Dodger Stadiums and Fenway Parks of the world."

It was honestly not as bad as I thought it would be. \nThere were 3 things that were not great compared to every other stadium though. The first was that they didn’t have Coca-Cola, or Pepsi, but RC COLA. Never seen any other park have this, and I don’t expect to see it ever again. Second, the bathrooms had troughs instead of urinals, which I was concerned about once I realized Wrigley, another old stadium, had them in 2014. Lastly, Andrew ordered pizza, and waited for 40 mins for them to text him it was ready. Then he went over to see what was up, and they said they didn’t have the ability to text him that it was ready, despite the app saying it would. So those three things were easily surpassed by every other stadium I’ve been to. \nHowever, it was kinda cool being in a “concrete jungle” stadium. The 2nd concourse was absolutely dead, but the main concourse was poppin’. What was interesting was while they had ramps, the other way to get up was to get to the 100 level concourse, then go up to the 200 level sections. From the 200 level, you could either go back down using those same stairs, or go up the stairs to the 200 level concourse. From there you could go to the 300 level seats. So it was the first stadium I’d been to (to my knowledge) where you could access all the decks just by going throughout the sections. I took some pictures on the top deck, which was honestly pretty neat. There is something really satisfying about the circular nature of the stadium, despite it being outdated and surpassed. Our seats were pretty decent, though they didn’t feel as close to the 200 level seats in SF. Overall decent to good experience, and I would honestly rather go here again than Yankee Stadium."

It was a very intimate feel, which was amazing I thought. \nWe had some fun beyond center field in a relatively new “party deck” area, and the Dbacks had batting practice. A relief pitcher, Bret de Geus was giving kids baseballs, and one kid gave his bracelet to him as a trade for a ball! Andrew also gave his necklace to him, which was neat. \nThe game was pretty exciting, the Giants took what seemed like a commanding lead before Alex Wood just absolutely lost it in the 6th inning after looking nearly unhittable for the first 5 innings. The Giants took the lead in the 8th, before Jake McGee struggled in the 9th and walked a few guys, which resulted in the Dbacks tying the game. The Giants ended up walking it off, via an error batted by recent acquisition Kris Bryant! Very exciting game, and the park was amazing, a close second to Dodger Stadium.

A nice hat though, very comfortable and looks cool.\nThe food options were less than stellar, but they had a few good ones here and there. We unfortunately sat in front of the scoreboard in right field, so we lost out on the stuff on there, but the left field scoreboard gave most of the information that was out of our view. I went up to the 3rd deck in the later innings to get a picture from the top-most row behind home plate. We got to see Shohei Ohtani, who pitched a great game and lead off the game with a double. Unfortunately that was all he did with the bat, I was hoping for a home run since we were in prime home run territory.

I went to this game with several friends, though this was notably the first game since July of 2019 that I hadn't gone to with Andrew, as he was studying abroad. The game had enormous playoff implications, as the Mariners were tied with the Red Sox for the second wild card spot. The Red Sox played the Nationals, and won, so the Mariners had to win just to keep pace.\nThe crowd was a sellout, the first since Opening Day 2019, which I was also in attendance for. The first inning was great, since Marco cruised through. The Mariners scored what would end up being their only run in the bottom of the 2nd inning. The crowd understandably went wild when that happened. Unfortunately, Marco struggled mightily in the 3rd, giving up 2 runs before recoring an out. While those would be the only two runs he allowed, that proved to be enough as the Mariners offense could just not get anything going that night. They had runners on first and third in the bottom of the 7th with nobody out, and struck out three times to end the inning.\nThe game proved to be very boring, since there was no scoring after the top of the 3rd. I and everyone else in the park was so prepared to get very excited, and that moment just never came. The game was followed by a fireworks show, and we got to sit on the field, which was neat. The grass was so short and the dirt was so well kept that it almost felt fake, like turf. While I was very disappointed after the game, the fireworks show helped a little bit at least. \nUnfortunately, the Mariners did not make it to the playoffs, or even a tiebreaker game. However, they did finish 90-72, blowing their pre-season projections out of the water and surprising everyone. Now that they're not in a rebuilding year, the front office has to show they mean business by helping out this club by signing an infield bat like Marcus Semien, and probably a front-of-the-line starter as well. While the end of the year was disappointing, this definitely feels like just the beginning, unlike 2014, 2016, or 2018. I'm excited to see what the future holds."

To account for that, the first week of games was rescheduled throughout the season, and the first series was moved to the end of the season. As a result, the Mariners opened up on the road in Minnesota and Chicago before coming home to face the Astros for their home opener. It happened to fall on Jackie Robinson Day, which is the first one I've been in attendance for. It was the 75th anniversary of Jackie's debut, and as a result the 42s on everyone's back were in Dodger Blue. I wasn't a huge fan of this, since it seemed to honor the Dodgers for no reason, but it honestly didn't look half bad.\nThe Mariners went out to an early lead, scoring a run in the top of the first, and they could have gotten more. Fortunately, that didn't end up mattering as they had a baserunner on every inning and scored 11 runs. Mariners new leadoff man Adam Frazier had his best night of the young season, with 4 hits and 4RBI, becoming the first Mariner leadoff hitter to do that since Ichiro in 2004. Jesse Winker and Eugenio Suarez, the other two big acquisitions also had great nights, with Suarez's home run capping off the scoring for the Mariners. Marco Gonzales had a great outing, throwing 7 innings of 1-run ball, looking infinitely better than he did in his first outing in Minnesota. While I was near certain Julio Rodriguez was going to hit his first major league home run in this game, he did manage to get a base hit and walk, good steps towards moving his very low average up.\nWith Carlos Correa now in Minnesota, the Astros had 3 hitters (Altuve, Bregman, Gurriel) still left from the 2017 team, and they still absolutely heard it from the fans. In the 8th inning, when the Mariners were already leading 9-1, Altuve came up with two outs and the bases empty, the booing was especially pertinent, and it quickly turned into cheers as Altuve went down on 3 pitches. A really strong way to start out the year at home for the Mariners, as this more than doubled their season-high run total in a game (previous was only 5). While nothing super weird happened like 2021's opening day, this game was nothing but positives for the Mariners."

		"notes": "I went to this game with a couple friends, one of them Andrew, and another Zach for the first time. The Mariners were coming off a 4-game sweep in Boston and a 3-7 road trip. They had been playing very poorly to say the least. This was the Mariners first game against the A's this season, and because of their poor play the Mariners found themselves sharing last place with the A's. The game got off to a slow start, as both pitchers hung up zeros for the first two and a half innings. \nIn the bottom of the first, we were saying that now was a good time for Julio Rodriguez's first home run in Seattle. While he didn't get it in the first, he went deep in the 3rd inning to give the Mariners a 3-0 lead. Unfortunately, Marco Gonzales nearly completely fell apart in the 4th inning, giving up 3 runs and throwing 33 pitches in the inning. The Mariners offense didn't miss a beat as they scored 2 more runs in the bottom of the 4th. To this point, Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh was hitting below .100. Andrew said \"Cal Raleigh hit home run challenge (impossible)\", and shortly after Cal hit a 2-run home run to give the Mariners the lead! \nMarco held the A's off the board and the Mariners scored 2 runs again in the bottom of the 5th. While Eugenio Suarez was up, I said \"homer on the next pitch\" when the count was 2-0. He ended up hitting the home run on a 3-1 but I still kinda called it. At this point the Mariners had a comfortable 7-3 lead, but Marco fell apart again in the 6th. While getting a groundout on the first batter, he gave up two singles which ended his night. Rookie reliever Penn Murfee came in, and while having pitched well to this point was not good here, allowing both inherited runners to score and then one more, trimming the lead to 7-6. Sergio Romo then came in, and managed to get the final two outs without allowing any more runs. \nThe next half inning, Andrew tried the reverse-jinx again by saying \"Cal Raleigh hit a single challenge (impossible)\", and surprisingly the impossible became reality as Cal Raleigh followed his home run up by a single, giving him his first multi-hit game on the season. The scoring was finished after that 6th inning for the A's, and the Mariners managed to clutch out a one-run win, something that has become more difficult this season after being a normality in 2021. Diego Castillo pitched a brilliant 8th inning, striking out the side and giving a glimpse of his return to form. Paul Sewald pitched the 9th, and while he allowed the tying run to make it to scoring position after a single and wild pitch, it would stay there as he got a groundout to Ty France to end the game and seal an important win for the Mariners to start the homestand."

		"notes": "This game was Star Wars Fireworks night. Since I already had plans with my friend Jason, we decided to tack on the Mariners game to our day. I also planned on getting a Julio Rodriguez jersey, but they didn't have any in the Northwest Green, so my search will continue elsewhere.\n\nThe game started out pretty good, as the Mariners scored one run in each of the first three innings. Included in that was a Cal Raleigh home run, which Jason and I once again joked \"CAL RALEIGH HIT A HOME RUN CHALLENGE: IMPOSSIBLE!\" Raleigh of course, proved the impossible to be reality and smacked a home run. He nearly missed a second one later in the game, as he drilled a double down the left field line that hit the top half of the wall.\n\nThe Mariners really broke out in the 4th inning. With walks from Jesse Winker and Taylor Trammell, and an Adam Frazier single, J.P. Crawford came up with the bases loaded and took a walk himself to make it a 4-0 lead. Ty France was next up, and did Ty France things by lining a double down the left field line to score 3 and blow the game open at 7-0. The Mariners would finish their scoring in the 6th, with the aforementioned Cal Raleigh double followed by a Taylor Trammell single.\n\nSomething I have intentionally not mentioned to this point was that Robbie Ray had a no-hitter through 6 innings. I noticed it after 4, and mentioned it to Jason after 5. Someone sitting next to me mentioned that when he was at Felix's perfect game, he and his dad didn't say anything, since he was getting after someone who mentioned the fact that a no-hitter was going on. I had to chime in, clarify that I heard him correctly and mention that I was also at the perfect game. I think that's the first time I've encountered someone else at a Mariners game who also went to Felix's perfect game. Anyway, after Ray got two outs to start the 7th, a little dribbler was hit by Max Stassi that Ray failed to field correctly. However, it was scored as a hit, which was responded to by resounding boos across the stadium. I also thought it should have been scored as an error, as 9 times out of 10 Robbie Ray makes that play. Maybe even 99 times out of 100, it was just a weird bounce off his glove. Unfortunately, the scoring decision stuck. \n\nRay got the last out of the 7th, but gave up a triple and double to start the 8th, which would end his night. While those hits did in fact ensure that the misplay wasn't the only thing keeping it from a no-hitter, I can imagine Ray would have pitched differently and might not have given up those hits if the no-hitter were intact. Ray received a standing ovation when he left the ballgame, a truly masterful performance with 10 strikeouts. Since instituting his two-seam fastball, he's pitched much better. Whether this version of Robbie Ray sticks remains to be seen (I'm writing this the day of the game), but the signs are very encouraging.\n\nThe Mariners put Penn Murfee in for the 8th, which he finished off no problem. With a double header the next day, the Angels opted to save their bullpen and pitched Jack Mayfield, their starting 3rd basemen. Unfortunately, the Mariners didn't manage to score off him. Roenis Elias closed out the win with ease.\n\nThe fireworks show followed, and was spectacular, as all Mariners fireworks shows are. They played many classic Star Wars songs, while working in Mariners highlight clips with Star Wars backgrounds on the jumbotron. A very good win and game experience for this one."

		"notes": "Somehow, after all these years this was my firs time seeing the Rangers play the Mariners at T-Mobile Park. Opening Day 2020 was originally scheduled in late March against them, but that was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I also saw the Rangers play in Oakland in 2021. My dad and I took the light rail to this game, which was a first for us. Chris Flexen started this game, who I felt like I'd already seen pitch many times to this point. Unfortunately Julio Rodriguez didn't play in this game, due to a sore wrist he suffered before the All-Star Break. Despite performing in the derby and doing fine, the pain recurred and he had to sit out 4 days, this being the last.\n\nThe scoring started in the 3rd, with a couple singles, groundout and a wild pitch giving the Rangers a 1-0 lead. Fortunately, that lead didn't last long and the Mariners scored 2 in the 4th to give them a lead. The Mariners would tack on with a solo home run from Ty France in the 5th, though the Rangers would get that run right back with a home run by Adolis Garcia. The Mariners got a 4th run off a groundout. The 9th inning was a little rocky. The inning started with a home run from Nathaniel Lowe off Diego Castillo, which was not exactly inspiring. Leody Taveras followed with a single, and then a walk from Kole Calhoun. At this point there are runners on 1st and 2nd with nobody out, clinging to a 1 run lead. Castillo did get a strikeout of Ezequiel Duran, but Servais opted to go to Erik Swanson, who really had a dominant season to that point. He got a foul popout and a weak groundout to end the game, giving the Mariners yet another 1-run victory.\n\nOne other note from this game; in the past, the Mariners had soft serve ice cream all throughout the park, and was something I always got. However, I walked around the entire main concourse to only find one location with this soft serve ice cream. I ordered the ice cream, noticing someone else at another register receiving theirs. However, I was told I'd have to wait 20 mins for the machine to cool down or something. I had already paid for it to this point, so I decided to wait. After about 10 minutes I got back in line to check on the status, and then was told that they weren't selling ice cream for the time being. So I didn't get my ice cream, and I also had to get a refund since I already paid for it. While the manager for that specific stand offered a replacement item, I insisted I wanted a refund as there was nothing else there I wanted. So I didn't end up with any ice cream, and will likely not pay for anything until receiving the item. I also won't be looking for soft serve anymore, since it's proven to be fruitless a few times this season already. I really hope it returns at some point."

		"notes": "This weekend the Mariners were inducting Ichiro to the Mariners Hall of Fame. This move was obvious to anyone who watched Ichiro at any point in his prime. While we were planning on attending this anyway, it happened to land on my 22nd birthday, making it the first time I'd attend a Mariners game on my birthday. Coming from north of Seattle, we opted to park at the recently opened Northgate Link light rail station and ride the train to the stadium. Ideally it would be cheaper than parking at the stadium (it was) and quicker getting out of the stadium after the game (it wasn't, like at all).\n\nWe arrived to the park maybe 10 or 15 minutes after the gates opened, but the lines were still extremely long to get into the park. The wait was about 15 or 20 minutes to get in. We were also able to get one of the Ichiro t-shirts they were giving away to the first 20,000 fans, so I was glad we were able to get one without having to get in line before the gates opened.\n\nWe made our way to our seats, which were excellent, perhaps my favorite general area to sit, which was the third base side. We were in section 141, row 19. The ceremony began at 6:30, with longtime Mariners broadcaster Rick Rizzs starting it off. He introduced the other Mariners Hall of Famers, to which each received resounding applause, as well as other important guests. Videos were shown of players expressing their amazement of Ichiro's ability and career, as well as his dedication as a person. Mariners owner John Stanton gave a speech, and for maybe the first time ever, Ichiro himself gave a speech in English. Ichiro has traditionally used an interpreter to avoid things getting miscommunicated or lost in translation, but perhaps since his speech was written down he opted to do the speech in English. The speech was excellent, with some humorous anecdotes and plenty of acknowledgments mixed in. \n\nOnce he finished the speech, it was already 7:15, 5 minutes past the originally scheduled first pitch. The game started at around 7:30. We got the privilege of seeing Luis Castillo for the first time, who the Mariners acquired at the trade deadline from the Cincinnati Reds. Along with Robbie Ray, he's helped solidify the top of the starting rotation and given us an ace for the first time since Felix Hernandez. While the Guardians were fouling off an absolute ton of pitches, he only gave up 1 run over 6 innings while throwing 115 pitches, 85 for strikes.\n\nAs for the Mariners offense, Eugenio Suarez led off the 2nd inning with a solo shot to give the Mariners an early 1-0 lead. Julio followed that up in the 3rd inning with another solo home run, extending the lead to 2-0. In the middle of the game, Ty France got ejected by the home plate umpire, who was having quite a bad day. Ty France told him \"All three strikes you called were balls.\" The umpire asked him to repeat what he said, France did, and then the umpire gave him the hook, in a move that only reinforces the consensus that umpires are soft. Anyway, Jake Lamb replaced him at first base, and hit a solo home run of his own in the bottom of the 7th, extending the Mariners lead to 3-1; Jose Ramirez hit a home run in the 4th.\n\nTo this point in the season, the Mariners had a 51-0 record when leading after 7 innings. Andres Muñoz, who has become an excellent weapon out of the Mariners bullpen, came in to start the 8th. Left fielder Steven Kwan worked a walk on a questionable ball 3 call that really should have been strike 3. Amed Rosario followed up with a single, and Jose Ramirez, being Jose Ramirez hit a double down the left field line (hitting left-handed) and brought the Guardians within a run. Josh Naylor followed that up with an RBI groundout, that was hit too softly to get the runner coming home. Directly after that, Andres Giminez lined out to center field, now giving the Guardians a 4-3 lead.\n\nIn the bottom of the 8th, James Karinchak came in to pitch for the Guardians. There had been some rumblings of him using sticky stuff again, as his spinrate had increased recently after seeing a drop in 2021 after the sticky stuff ban was actually enforced. He sat down the Mariners in order, taking what felt like forever between pitches as he'd spin the ball around in almost a juggling fashion as well as touching the back of his hat between every pitch. Despite being checked by the umpire, they either weren't thorough or Karinchak was able to rub off the substance before being checked, avoiding consequence. However, I'm still suspicious that he's doing something illegal, and I'm not just saying this because the Mariners did poorly against him.\n\nWhile the Mariners sat down the Guardians in order, the Guardians did the same for the Mariners in the 9th, despite the Mariners sending up Julio Rodriguez, hot-hitting Dylan Moore, and Mitch Haniger. I didn't realize until after the game that the Mariners only had 3 reach base all game, and those were the three solo home runs. So despite the home runs, a really poor showing from the Mariners offense. While the ceremony was enjoyable, I do wish the Mariners had been able to squeeze out a win on my birthday."

		"notes": "With the season winding down, I wanted to go to one more game. I had seen a game every month, so I wanted to complete the set. The Mariners had played poorly on the previous road trip, going 3-7 against losing teams. While they were still in a great spot to make the playoffs, Mariners fans were still nervous given how the Mariners have choked in the past. The most recent example of this was the previous Sunday game against the Royals. The Mariners had an 11-2 lead, only to give up 11 runs in the 6th inning and ended up losing 13-12. That being said, the Mariners held the 3rd wild card spot going into this game. They had lost the first game of the series, but won the 2nd. The Baltimore Orioles, who were the team behind the Mariners, had lost before this game, bringing the Mariners \"magic number\" down to 2. This meant the Mariners needed a combination of 2 Mariners wins and 2 Orioles losses, more than doable in the final week of the season.\n\nThe game started out well, with Marco Gonzales striking out the side in order. Mitch Haniger got the Mariners an early 2-0 lead with a 2-run home run that traveled 442 feet, the longest home run hit in Seattle this season. It was also his first home run in over a month. However, that lead wouldn't last long as the Rangers would come back with 4 runs in the top of the 3rd inning to give them a 4-2 lead, on home runs by Sam Huff, Marcus Semien, and Adolis Garcia. While Marco had a good first two innings, this wasn't a great sign. Fortunately, the Mariners came right back as Mitch Haniger hit another 2-run home run to tie the game at 4.\n\nThe Mariners didn't go long without a lead as Jarred Kelenic hit a two run opposite field bomb to net a 6-4 lead. Kelenic would extend this lead by hitting another home run, this time a solo shot, in the 6th inning to make it 7-4.\n\nIn the top of the 7th, the Mariners did a very cool intro for Paul Sewald, which involved turning off most of the stadium lights and shining a spotlight on him as he ran out from the bullpen. However, Sewald had a poor outing as he gave up back to back home runs to Marcus Semien and Nathaniel Lowe, the latter of which was absolutely yoked. Clinging to a one-run lead, the Mariners sent Andres Muñoz back out for the 8th after he got the final out of the 7th. He allowed two singles to lead off the inning, which was followed by a double play and a lineout. However, the Rangers did manage to tie the game on that double play. The Mariners were gonna have to come back once again if they wanted to win this game.\n\nThe 8th and 9th innings were unceremonious after that, as the Mariners didn't pose a huge threat in either inning. Still tied after 9 innings, this game went into the 10th. The automatic runner was placed at 2nd, and Erik Swanson came in to pitch. He gave up a pinch-hit single to Kole Calhoun, who has been a thorn in the Mariners side in recent years. Swanson fended off the Rangers after that, but now the Mariners had 3 outs to tie or win the game. Eugenio Suarez started the inning with a single, pushing automatic runner Sam Haggerty (pinch running for Ty France) to 3rd. Cal Raleigh followed that up with a sacrifice fly to left, which then scored Haggerty, knotting the game up once again. While Carlos Santana followed with a walk, Jarred Kelenic popped out to send the game to at least one more inning.\n\nThe 11th started with a sacrifice bunt by the Rangers, which was proceeded by a sac fly. Haniger made a hard throw home from right field, but it went over the catchers head, and might not have been in time anyway. Nathaniel Lowe grounded out to end the inning, putting the Mariners down to their last 3 outs once again. Dylan Moore lead off the inning with a single, allowing the automatic runner Kelenic to advance to 3rd. Mariners manager Scott Servais opted to pinch hit Luis Torrens for Adam Frazier. While ideally this game would end here, if it didn't the Mariners would have likely put Torrens at 2nd base, despite him being the 3rd-string catcher. Torrens lined a single into right field to score Kelenic. Next up, J.P. Crawford. J.P. showed bunt for the first few pitches, but on the third pitch, Dylan Moore stole third base, eliminating the need for the bunt. Immediately after, Crawford lined a ball towards the third baseman, which bounced out of his glove and into the outfield, giving the Mariners a much-needed win to reduce their magic number to 1.\n\nAs I am writing this log the next day, I am happy to report that the Mariners clinched their playoff spot in the very next game, as Cal Raleigh launched a walkoff home run to reach the postseason for the first time in 21 years. At the time of writing, I have tickes to a potential ALCS game in Seattle, so let's hope I'll be writing about that one too."

This trip had been in the works since Christmas 2021, but the 2022 lockout postponed it by a year; planning just became too difficult with the uncertainty. A somewhat rare night spring training game, the weather was very nice and warm. The park was nothing super interesting to be honest, which I kind of expected given that it's spring training. Peoria Stadium has some seats going from the left field foul pole, around home plate and to the right field foul pole. Beyond the outfield is just a grass lawn, which allows people to bring blankets or yard chairs or whatever they'd like to sit on. While I was here, I decided to finally purchase a northwest green Julio Rodriguez jersey. I had been after one for several months, but the online store nor the Mariners Team Store had any available. But waiting paid off as this one came with the 2023 All Star Game logo patch, as the game will be held in Seattle.\n\nThe Mariners got off to a hot start, scoring 4 runs in the first inning and didn't look back. They scored 5 more in the 4th, and won handily by a score of 10-5. Sadly, this would be the only game of the 3 we saw of the Mariners where they'd win. But given that it was spring training, the wins and losses mean far less than during the regular season. Also, this was <i>technically</i> the first Mariners road game I saw. But it was spring training, and it was also in their home stadium, as they and the Padres share the complex. So this doesn't count."

There was a neat walkway into the complex alongside a pond. The walkway was also lined with Dodgers all stars and MVP winners, which was very neat. They share the complex with the White Sox, and it looked like there was a parallel walkway with this same stuff on that side. There were also some large Dodgers and White Sox logos, and I managed to snap a photo in front of the Dodgers one. Not sure what it is, but seeing large logos that you can take a photo in front of is neat, somewhat akin to the giant hats the Angels have at Angel Stadium.\n\nThe stadium itself was also very cool, as there was some much needed cover for the shade. Despite going out of my way to purchase sunscreen, I still forgot to actually use it, so the shade was much appreciated. We ate a relatively late breakfast (first trip to Waffle House), and since spring training food isn't nearly as high quality as what you'll find in a big league stadium, I decided to purchase peanuts at a baseball game for the very first time, if you can believe it. I can see why they're such a classic ballpark snack, as it filled my needs well for an afternoon at the yard.\n\nIn terms of the actual game, there weren't actually too many notable players playing today. Mookie Betts was still away at the WBC, so the only notable Dodger superstar that actually played was Freddie Freeman. The White Sox also didn't really have anyone that jumped off the page for me. Something that lowkey was very strange was that the White Sox actually lost their DH midway through the game. I have no idea how this would happen in a spring training game, when you have all those guys on the bench and are trying to get as many guys in as possible. The move was Victor Reyes from DH to left field, and center fielder Jake Marisnick was removed from the game, presumably due to injury (I'm not sure how I'd look up injury information for a spring training game). In the end, a good baseball experience."

This ballpark was also very nice, and while better than Peoria, probably just below Camelback Ranch. The Reds and Guardians share this complex. Having just been eliminated from the WBC, Julio Rodriguez was back and starting this game. It was cool to see his interactions with fans and players, since you're rarely close enough to see it. Speaking of close, we were maybe 5 rows behind the Mariners dugout, almost certainly the closest I've been in a game. The previous closest was probably sitting in Fenway Park, which was a great spot because of the section configuration. I've also sat about 10-20 rows behind the Mariners dugout in Seattle, but it's been a while, and isn't my favorite view anyway.\n\nLuis Castillo was making one of his final tune-ups before Opening Day, which coincidentally would also be against these Guardians, in Seattle. Castillo did well, giving up only 3 runs over 4.1 innings. Unfortunately, the Mariners were down 5-1 going into the 9th inning. They managed to rally for 3 runs, but failed to push the needle further as they ultimately lost 5-4. An exciting game at the end."

It reminded me a bit of the Palace of the Fans in Cincinnati from the early 1900s, and the very old South End Grounds in Boston from the late 1800s.\n\nNotable for this game, Jacob deGrom was making his Cactus League debut for the Rangers, as he had previously spent his entire career with the Mets. deGrom pitched well, allowing zero runs over three innings. The Mariners ended up losing this game as well, 2-1. For the Cactus League stadiums I visited, I'd probably rank them in this order: <ol><li>Camelback Ranch</li><li>Goodyear Ballpark</li><li>Surprise Stadium</li><li>Peoria Stadium</li></ol>\nI will eventually add a filter for these games, but I wanted to at least get the game notes in so I have them."

After breaking their infamous 21 year postseason drought, this was the first time I got to experience a home opener after a postseason appearance. The Mariners showed a sit down interview with Cal Raleigh about breaking the drought, which was a very neat clip. The Guardians starting catcher was former Mariner Mike Zunino, which created a powerful photo when he was watching the video while preparing for the game on the field. For non-Mariners fans, Mike Zunino was basically supposed to be what Cal Raleigh is now, but stunted development and continued struggles made that an impossibility with his time in Seattle.\n\nThe player introductions were as hype as ever. Nearly everyone got a hearty cheer, and made me realize how cool it is to have these players that have been around long enough to gain a positive reputation. Many years under Jerry Dipoto we've had high turnover, but now that we finally have a bit of a core, and even some of those edge pieces, we have several players that are now household names that are all actually good baseball players. Julio Rodriguez, coming off his Rookie of the Year season, got a lot of applause as one would expect. Mariners fans were also extremely excited for Jarred Kelenic, with his impressive showing in Spring Training despite his quite poor performance thus far as a big-leaguer. Understandably, no one on the Guardians elicited much applause, except for the aforementioned Mike Zunino, who honestly received a lot more applause than I was expecting.\n\nLuis Castillo was making his first Opening Day start for the Mariners. Watching him pitch made me realize how cool it was that the Mariners managed to trade for an undoubted ace in the middle of the previous season, and have him make the Opening Day start the next season. This was another thing that I could never dream of in previous seasons. We had Felix Hernandez for many years, as a homegrown pitcher. But the other trades the Mariners have made for starting pitchers have all been middle or backend starter guys. The Mariners did trade for Marco Gonzales, who was their Opening Day starter for a few seasons, but he is definitely not an ace, despite his extremely good 2020 season that perhaps made some Mariners fans think otherwise. The Mariners never really had the trade capital to trade for such a starter, and would often be beat out by other teams. But to be able to not only beat out other teams, but the Yankees were one of those, who Castillo faced in one of his final starts as a Red, and was the team Castillo started against in his Mariner debut. Just incredible poetry there, especially when the Yankees next choice, Frankie Montas was acquired and then injured shortly afterwards. He is starting the 2023 on the injured list as well.\n\nAnyway, Luis Castillo shoved, as expected. There was a brief scare in the 3rd inning, when Guardians right fielder Will Brennan hit a ball that struck Castillo. Fortunately, Castillo was relatively unscathed as it managed to be softened by his long hair, and after a few warmup pitches, was set to go. Something notable is he managed to strike out Steven Kwan and Myles Straw swinging, both scrappy players who have an extremely low swing and miss rate. After six scoreless innings, Scott Servais opted to move to his incredible bullpen to handle the rest of the game. Matt Brash was the first reliever to come in, and immediately showed off his incredible slider by striking out Jose Ramirez swinging. It was so nasty that Ramirez spun around and fell over, creating an amazing contender for \"Bad Swing of the Year\" on day one. Paul Sewald followed in the 8th inning, sitting the Guardians down 1-2-3.\n\nTo this point, the game was still scoreless, and was going incredibly quickly with the help of the new pitch clock. After Trevor Stephan pitched the 7th inning, Cleveland manager Terry Francona opted to bring in James Karinchak. For those who have watched Karinchak in the past, you may know that he's relatively fidgety. He also struggled after the crackdown on sticky stuff back in 2021, but mysteriously was good again in the 2022 season, when umpires had stopped checking nearly as much; I even noted this when he pitched against the Mariners in 2022 in a game I attended. However, MLB noted that they would begin checking for sticky stuff more diligently again in 2023, meaning Karinchak had a couple things working against him that he'd need to quickly adapt to. The first hitter he'd face would be the Mariners #9 hitter, shortstop J.P. Crawford. While J.P. isn't an amazing hitter, he has a good eye and will take his walks. The at bat started off 0-2, but before the third pitch, Karinchak took too long, and was called for a pitch clock violation, the first of the game for either team. Fans immediately latched onto this and got very excited. The next pitch SAILED over the catchers head for ball 2. At this point, the fans knew it was time to try and get into Karinchak's head. They began counting down the pitch clock once it got to ten seconds, which created for an incredibly fun environment. J.P. Crawford ended up walking, though ball 4 was actually a foul ball, which is stupidly non-reviewable, thus giving the Mariners quite a break to start the inning. Next up was Julio, who made some contact off the end of the bat, which sadly resulted in a fly out to center. Next hitter Kolten Wong got to a 3-2 count, before being hit by a pitch to put runners on first and second for Ty France. On a 1-1 count, France hit a fly ball to right field that just got out of the park for a 3 run home run to give the Mariners a 3-0 lead. Francona at that point had seen enough, pulling Karinchak probably a batter too late. Cleveland pitcher Enyel de los Santos retired the next two Mariners in order, suddenly limiting the Guardians to their final 3 outs.\n\nIn to pitch was Mariners fireballer Andres Muñoz. While Paul Sewald led the Mariners with 20 saves last season, they largely didn't have an official closer, which was by design as they had enough good arms to work with whatever they had, and they'd often put Sewald in whenever the three best hitters were coming up for the opposing team instead of a save situation. All this to say, if the Mariners had one reliever who would be best suited for closer this 2023 season, Andres Muñoz is likely the best candidate. So we'll see how this plays out. Anyway, Muñoz got two ground ball outs to start the inning. However, Guardians shortstop Amed Rosario singled, and Jose Ramirez doubled on the very next pitch. Suddenly the tying run was at the plate in the form of Josh Bell, who could absolutely tie up the game with one swing. But in a 2-2 count, Bell grounded out to Ty France at first, who flipped it to Andres Muñoz for the final out, netting the Mariners another Opening Day win. Another wonderful Opening Day experience at T-Mobile Park."

		"notes": "Went to this game with my friend Jason, which is the 5th game we've attended together. Mariners came off a .500 road trip, which felt worse than it was, since the losses were a walk-off in extras in Cleveland, a walk-off in extras in Chicago (vs the Cubs), and then blowing a 7-0 lead. However, the 3 games in Chicago all contained a Jarred Kelenic home run, who really appears to be finally breaking out and learning how to succeed in MLB. His most recent home run prior to this game was a shot to dead center field in Chicago, and it made it to the <i>second deck</i>, which is just incredible.\n\nThis game was a Cal Raleigh clinch bobblehead giveaway, which we made it in time for. Marco Gonzales was scheduled to start the game for the Mariners, but only a few hours before first pitch, it was announced that he was going on paternity leave, and that Tommy Milone would be starting in his spot. He had pitched in 2019 and 2022 for the Mariners, and despite being below average, always seemed to keep you in the game. On the second batter of the game, he surrendered a home run to Rockies right fielder Kris Bryant, whose contract has essentially been thought of universally a bad deal for both sides. He got paid, but he has to play in Colorado, and the Rockies aren't exactly trying to contend. Somehow, Bryant has not yet hit a home run in Coors Field, though was injured for a significant portion of 2022, the first year of his deal. I was slightly worried, but Milone bounced back and got the next two outs without issue.\n\nKelenic started in left field for the Mariners, which was somewhat of a big deal because he was planned to be used against right handed pitchers, and the Rockies were starting lefty Austin Gomber. But hitting home runs in three consecutive games seemed to push Scott Servais over the edge, and gave Kelenic the opportunity to start against a southpaw. In his first at bat of the game, in the bottom of the second with a runner on first, he hit an absolute nuke out to straightaway center field to give the Mariners a 2-1 lead they wouldn't look back on. The Mariners played add-on in the bottom of the 4th with doubles from Julio Rodriguez and Ty France. A walk to the next batter would end Gomber's night. Milone wouldn't last much longer, as he was taken out in the top of the 5th after getting the first two outs. Trevor Gott came on, who closed out the 5th but ran into some trouble in the 6th, allowing consecutive singles to open the inning followed by a popfly, walk and a single. Scott Servais went to his bullpen again, this time for Matt Brash. Despite walking in a run, Brash got the final two outs on strikeouts and put out the small fire. Gabe Speier, who had been a nice surprise for the Mariners, came into the 8th and got 3 outs in 2 pitches, after Justin Topa pitched the 7th. Paul Sewald came into the 9th, and retired the side in order to seal the win for the Mariners."

This was an end-of-year work celebration, which was exciting. It was also paid for by my job, which was a huge plus. This was a student employee position at my university, so it was a nice soft-end to this job. The Mariners were wearing their City Connect uniforms for only the second time, as they had been on the road the previous two Friday home games since the debut. Hence, this was my first time seeing them in-person.\n\nOur seats were in the upper deck, section 311, row 20 or so. I have sat a lot of places in T-Mobile Park. I have <i>never</i> sat this far back. Truly the nosebleeds of all nosebleeds. It was a 7:10 first pitch, but it was a pretty hot day in Seattle, almost 80°. A few of us went to hang out at the patio area behind home plate on the upper deck, which was a nice way to cool off and hang out before first pitch. As a result, I missed the national anthem for perhaps the first time ever where I was actually on time for the game.\n\nOnce the game started, we all immediately realized the seats were a problem. We were right in the sun, and while it wouldn't be in our faces forever, it was still really hot. It was also extremely difficult to see the ball when hit off the bat. One of our group members went to look for seats closer to the field, and he managed to find many seats in section 138. After the top of the first, we all went down to those seats. Unfortunately we missed a Julio Rodriguez home run in the process, but these seats were <i>much</i> better, some of the best I'd had in a while. No usher ever asked to check our tickets, so we were able to hang out down there the entire game.\n\nIn what was lined up to be a good pitching match, George Kirby was facing Pittsburgh's Mitch Keller. However, it ended up being the complete opposite. Unfortunately, Kirby got hit really hard for some reason. He gave up 7 runs, all earned. He gave up 4 home runs, which is very much not like him. There were some concerns online that there were some juiced ball shenanigans going on, citing that it was Memorial Day weekend and there would be a higher viewership than normal. But it may have just been because of the high temperatures I mentioned earlier. While Kirby had a poor day, Keller ended up giving up 6 earned runs of his own. However, by the time he was removed from the game in the 7th inning, it was already 10-6 Pirates. While I was hoping for some sort of comeback, the Mariners fell short and the final score was 11-6. There was a postgame sing-along fireworks show, which was fun. Despite the loss, it was still a fun time at the ballpark."

		"notes": "My brother and sister-in-law live in southern California, and I went to visit them shortly after I graduated college. One thing I wanted to do was attend a game at Dodger Stadium, and so we did just that. My brother is very much not a sports fan, but he agreed to go to this game with me. It was the first time ever just the two of us went to a game together. The game started at 7:10, and I wanted to make sure we got there plenty early. We arrived shortly after 5 and made our way inside. This was my first time revisiting a ballpark outside of Seattle, which was super neat. While Dodger Stadium hadn't changed too much since my visit only two years prior, the Dodgers did carve out a section in the left and right field bleachers for some more standing room ahead of the All-Star Game in 2022. So there was a little bit more of a sightline for those walking on the concourse.\n\nIn my initial review of Dodger Stadium, I noted that it may be my favorite park of all the ones I've been to, and I think this still holds true. While the second visit was slightly less exciting, it was still a very good experience. We sat in section LG 153, which is on the second deck on the third base side. I noticed the stadium used the term \"loge\" to describe this section, which piqued my interest. In my visit to Fenway Park, we were treated to loge boxes, which had very small sections and provided an incredibly easy entry and exit from your seats. The rows in Fenway were 8 seats, which was split in half with a metal railing, so it was effectively only 4 seats. Dodger Stadium's loge seats were also 8 seats to a row, but they weren't split in half with a railing like Fenway's were. I was happy to see these seats in another stadium, and I still argue that there should be more of them around baseball. While I think I prefer Fenway's layout, of the split 8, the continuous 8 at Dodger Stadium were still excellent. Another neat touch the Dodgers add is in the simple but elegant numbering system of the sections. All sections on the third base side are odd-numbered, and all on the first base side are even-numbered. This makes it so much easier to find your seats. In almost all other ballparks I've been to, the sections just start at 1 and count up. While this seems logical, the first solution isn't always the best. The Dodgers improve on this by letting you know almost immediately upon entering the stadium, roughly where your seats are, narrowing your search by half. This is an incredibly effective solution to making sure fans know where they need to go without having to direct them around a ton. Our seats had a great view, and I'm starting to believe that the second deck in ballparks are home to my favorite seats. It's a perfect middle ground between the closeness of the field level and the view of the upper deck, keeping you close to the action but not sacrificing the view.\n\nRegarding the food situation, I got some chicken strips and fries from Sweet Chick, which were quite good, definitely better than T-Mobile Park's chicken strips. It made me realize how much worse T-Mobile's food quality has gotten. It's not even a situation of quality over quantity at Dodger Stadium either, as they have a huge variety of selections that all sounded extremely good. So I don't understand what's going on with the food situation at T-Mobile Park, but when you're paying <i>that</i> much for food, it better be at least halfway decent.\n\nMookie Betts hit a leadoff home run in the bottom of the first, which he also did in my first visit to Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers scored again in the 2nd, also on a run driven in by Mookie, but it was only a deep sacrifice fly instead of the grand slam I thought it might be off the bat. Betts flew out to center again later in the game, and was seeing the ball well that night. The Astros tied the game on back-to-back home runs by Maricio Dubón and Kyle Tucker in the top of the 4th, but the Dodgers took the lead right back in the bottom of the frame. Unfortunately, there would be no more scoring and the final score was 3-2. The 2021 game at Dodger Stadium was much more interesting, but this one was still a good experience. The Dodger fans were still VERY loud with their boos for the 2017 Astros, who at this point really boiled down to just Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. There were also some \"cheater\" chants at one point in the game. Following the game, the Dodgers put on a fireworks show, which they seemingly do every Friday night after a home game. This show was themed after the release of the new Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny film, which was set to hit theaters only a week after this game. They played a few songs from the movies, but overall the show was pretty underwhelming in my opinion. It was way shorter than I was expecting, but it was still decent enough. After all, the fireworks were solely a bonus anyway.\n\nIn conclusion, another good experience at Dodger Stadium. Of all the parks I've been to, this one especially I'd love to take a group of friends to someday. There's a large plaza beyond the outfield where people can just mingle and eat food, which is excellent. I imagine I will return to Dodger Stadium again sometime within the next few years or so."

		"notes": "This was the start of a 3-game trip for my dad and I, with another Houston game and a game in Arlington to follow. This game was very intriguing for a variety of reasons. Notably, it was my first time ever seeing the Mariners play on the road in the regular season (important distinction from spring training). Along with that, it was of course against the Astros, which is probably the closest team the Mariners could be considered rivals with. However, it's closer to a big brother/little brother situation, since the Mariners haven't finished above the Astros in the standings since 2016, and the Mariners have only had a winning record against the Astros in one of those seasons, in 2018. But also, it's the Astros, who are probably the most-hated team in baseball as of writing. As a result, it was a weird combination of being excited for watching my team play but also feeling very out of place in the enemy of all enemy territories.\n\nAnyway, we had some good seats, in section 110, row 22, a great view down the third base line, and perfect view of the main video board in right field. The game started out with a scorching-hot Julio singling, but he didn't come around to score. In the 2nd, the Mariners got more baserunners, but failed to score yet again. In the 3rd, Julio decided to drive himself in with an absolute nuke to left field to give the Mariners a 1-0 lead. However, the team struggled all game with runners in scoring position, finishing an incredible 0-17 in such situations. However, this was matched with an incredible pitching performance from Bryce Miller, who shut out the Astros through 6.1 innings. The Mariners managed only one more run against Astros starter J.P. France, who went 6 innings himself. I'd consider him incredibly lucky to have gone that deep allowing that few runs, as the Mariners had several hard hit balls that turned into outs and a ton of missed opportunities, as I've mentioned.\n\nAfter Bryce Miller's night ended, it was the bullpen's turn to shut the door. Justin Topa came in to succeed Miller, and got the final two outs of the 7th inning with ease. To my dad and I's surprise, he stayed out there for the 8th inning, but took care of the Astros again, setting them down in order. The Mariners failed to score any more insurance runs, so the score remained 2-0 going into the bottom of the 9th. Andres Muñoz was on to close the game for the Mariners. They had some shaky bullpen performances earlier in the week, with two from Muñoz himself; one a walkoff loss, and one that allowed a tie in the 9th inning. Paired with it being against the Astros, I was incredibly nervous for this inning. It started off not well, with a ground ball to third baseman Eugenio Suarez that Jose Altuve beat out for an infield single. The next batter, Alex Bregman, hit a ball to Suarez, who tossed it to second baseman Josh Rojas for the out on Altuve at second, but Rojas lost the ball on the transfer and didn't get the double play that looked certain when the play started. Up next was left fielder Yordan Alvarez, who hit a walkoff, 3-run home run to win Game 1 of the ALDS against the Mariners less than a year ago, and that was at the front of my mind. During his at bat, a ball got by catcher Cal Raleigh, which allowed Alex Bregman to move to 2nd, eliminating the double play from the equation. Alvarez then hit a ground ball to shortstop Jose Caballero, filling in for the concussed J.P. Crawford, and he misplayed it, allowing Alvarez to reach on what could have probably been scored as an error, but was ultimately ruled a hit. The next hitter was rookie catcher, who happened to be playing first base, Yainer Diaz. He turned out to be the final hitter of the ball game, as he hit the fourth ground ball of the inning, which went to Rojas, who got the out at second, and threw the ball without issue to first to get the third out and secure the Mariners 2-0 victory.\n\nThis win put the Mariners in sole possession of the 3rd wild card spot, as the previous owners of that spot, the Toronto Blue Jays, were walked off by the Cincinnati Reds in a 1-0 game not an hour prior to the end of the Mariners contest."

On our way back to our hotel Friday, I told my dad \"watch, the Mariners will drop 7 runs on Framber [Valdez] because baseball.\" For some variety, we sat in the upper deck, in section 322. Unfortunately, the air conditioning didn't reach that well at the top of the park, so it was much hotter up there than it was on the lower level. The Mariners got off to a quick start, scoring a run in the first, thanks to yet <i>another</i> hit from Julio Rodriguez. He quickly stole second, and the very next batter Eugenio Suarez singled him home. The Mariners scored again in the second, off a triple from rookie Cade Marlowe, on a ball that was just too far away for Astros center fielder Jake Meyers to come up with. The Mariners continued their scoring in the third, despite starting off with a strikeout to both Julio and Geno. However, Ty France, Teoscar Hernandez, and Cal Raleigh followed with three straight hits, scoring two more runs, while aided with an error. Dylan Moore and Jose Caballero both walked to load the bases, but the Mariners failed to break the game open and Cade Marlowe struck out for the Mariners third of the inning. Now leading 4-0, Logan Gilbert continued pitching well, though did give up a solo home run to Alex Bregman. This was actually the first time the Astros had scored in the two games, and the park got LOUD. Yainer Diaz followed in the 4th inning with a solo homer of his own, narrowing the lead to 4-2.\n\nHowever, the Mariners continued their offensive surge in the 5th. France led off the inning with a single, and after two outs, Dylan Moore hit a home run to get those two runs back the Mariners had given up, putting the score at now 6-2. The next hitter was Jose Caballero, and the very next pitch after Moore's homer went straight for Cabby's foot. He got hit, was not pleased, the teams started jawing at each other and the benches cleared. Quickly after it happened, Mariners reporter Ryan Divish Tweeted (x'd? posted?) that \"this had been building\" regarding the Cabby HBP. Earlier in the season, Astros veteran catcher Martin Maldonado took issue with Cabby's usage of the pitch clock. He often waits all the way until the 8-second mark to look up at the pitcher, which he has every right to do. Despite that, Maldonado had some words for him early in the season when the two teams were playing in Seattle. However, this time was about a different issue that Maldonado had with Caballero; he tends to crowd the plate, which I guess Maldy took issue with, so he must have said something to Cabby on Friday. So naturally, you hit the player who's bugging you (don't actually do this). The consensus by fans online and the Mariners reporters seems to be that it was in fact intentional, but the umpires decided to just give the teams both warnings, which I think is fine. Framber was near the end of his outing anyway. Cabby wasn't hurt at all, and immediately stole second after reaching first. He also attempted a steal of third on a foul ball, which I love. Alas, Valdez got the third out and the score was 6-2. Ryne Stanek came into the game in the 6th to relieve Valdez, and allowed the Mariners to load the bases. However, he managed to prevent any runs from scoring. The scoring calmed down after that for a while, until the Mariners added even more in the 8th inning, off a 2-run double from Teoscar Hernandez. The Mariners added on yet again in the 9th, with solo homers from Dylan Moore, his second homer of the game, and Sam Haggerty, his first of the year. The score was now 10-2. With the Mariners without an off day until the next Thursday, they opted to use a recent call up, Eduard Bazardo for his first Mariners appearance. He gave up a home run to Mauricio Dubón, which admittedly made me slightly worried for a second, despite the score being 10-3. He struck out the next hitter, allowed a double to the one after that, but then finished off the game with a groundout and another strikeout.\n\nThis was an incredible, resounding win by the Mariners. Coming to Minute Maid, despite the Mariners on a hot streak, there was still that bit of concern that they could fall flat on their face and get absolutely bodied by the Astros. While the first game was exciting, I was still slightly worried since they honestly could have lost it with all their missed scoring opportunities. However, this game the Mariners cashed in on several, and yet still left the bases loaded twice, which is just crazy. The Mariners ended up sweeping the Astros the next day, their first sweep of the Astros in Houston since a 4-game sweep in 2018. This also put them just a half game behind the Astros, meaning winning the division was now becoming a distinct possibility."

This was the only afternoon game on the trip.The game started at 1:35, which is one of the latest afternoon games I've been to. The game I went to at Wrigley way back in 2014 started at 1:20, and the Mariners 2017 home opener started at 2:10 for some reason; I'm pretty sure that's the only 2:10 start the Mariners have had in the past decade. Anyway, the stadium is enormous, and I'll go into detail more in my ballpark review. My friend from college Andrew, now living in Texas, joined my dad and I for this game. Max Scherzer started for the Rangers, and this was our second time seeing Scherzer, both times after being traded midseason in fact; we saw him in his Dodger debut in 2021. He had a really rough time this game, as the Brewers seemed to foul off a ton of pitches and he could just not really finish guys off. He was up to about 80 pitches through just 3 innings, which is such a high total. He only lasted 3.2, while giving up 3 runs. While that line alone doesn't sound too bad, he just threw far too many pitches to go further than that. The Brewers took the lead in the top of the 3rd, scoring 2 runs. The Rangers and scorching-hot Corey Seager answered back with a solo home run to make it a one-run game. There was a lot of nothing, and I ended up walking around the park a bit mid-game just to see some things. The Brewers scored 3 runs in the top of the 8th off of Rangers closer Will Smith, and despite making things interesting in the bottom of the 9th, the Rangers ultimately fell to the Brewers, 6-2, resulting in a sweep from the Brewers. This was the preferred outcome for the Mariners, as it allowed them to get even closer to the Rangers in the standings. While the game itself wasn't the most interesting, it's always great seeing a new stadium."

		"notes": "In my first return to T-Mobile Park for a baseball game in three months, the Mariners were taking on the Kansas City Royals in a critical series, as they all were at this point in the season. The Royals were bad, and were a virtual lock for 100 losses on the season. That being said, they played the Mariners incredibly tough just a week prior, with virtually every game being close despite the Mariners taking 3 of 4. That series in Kansas City was the start of an incredible road trip from the Mariners, in which they took 8 out of the 10 games, including a 3-game sweep of the ever dangerous Houston Astros. While the Mariners had been in pursuit of a wild card spot all season, they were suddenly only one game back of the division-leading Texas Rangers, who, despite leading the division most of the season, were suddenly falling apart, having lost each of their last 6 games. They were playing in Minnesota tonight against the Twins, so that game was almost guaranteed to end before the Mariners game did.\n\nMariners rookie Bryce Miller took the hill, easily sitting down the first three Royals hitters in order. The Royals were sending out Brady Singer, who had utterly dominated the Mariners his last time out, taking a perfect game against them into the 7th inning, until the Mariners finally notched a hit. However, the Mariners wasted no time in getting their first hit tonight, as shortstop J.P Crawford led off the bottom of the first by hitting a home run on Singer's very first pitch. The Mariners continued their early scoring, as catcher Cal Raleigh drove in Julio Rodriguez to give the Mariners a 2-0 lead. However, Bryce Miller suddenly ran into trouble in the next inning, giving up several hits that resulted in a 3-2 Royals lead, and throwing 35 pitches in the process, once the inning finally finished. After a couple quiet innings, the Mariners responded with 2 more runs to retake the lead for a 4-3 score.\n\nDespite the long 2nd, Miller lasted 4 innings, replaced in the 5th with Isaiah Campbell, who set down all three Royals he faced. The Royals starter also only lasted 4 innings, which was great news for the Mariners. Not only did they beat the guy who dominated them about ten days ago, but they got into one of the worst bullpens in baseball. They got to work right away by scoring 2 more on a wild pitch and a single. Going to the 6th, former Royal Gabe Speier emerged from Seattle's pen to set down the three batters he faced. However, Speier's successor, Matt Brash, got into some trouble in the seventh. Despite having nasty stuff that made even the best hitters look silly, he let up a two-run homer that cut the lead to just a run. Despite getting two outs, he yielded a triple, and was replaced with local kid Tayler Saucedo, who got the final out to end the threat.\n\nIt is now the seventh inning stretch, and the Rangers game has ended. They got thumped, 12-2. If the Mariners win this game, they will move into a tie for first place in the American League West. The Mariners do not score in the 7th, clinging to their 6-5 lead. The Mariners brought in their next reliever in Justin Topa, a 32-year old rookie who came out of nowhere to be absolutely dominant. He, like a few other relievers before him, set down the Royals in order. In the bottom of the 8th, the Mariners managed to tack on one more run to make it a 7-5 game. Onto the 9th, where Mariners closer Andres Muñoz was waiting. Despite nailing down 6 saves that month, he had blown a save to these same Royals in their series in Kansas City, being put into the uncomfortable position to throw 42 pitches, by far the most he had ever thrown in an appearance. The panic started immediately, as Royals first baseman Matt Beaty singled. Muñoz retired right fielder Drew Waters on a groundout, but then proceeded to walk Kyle Isbel, who hit that 2-run home run that Brash yielded earlier. Muñoz coaxed yet another groundout, now from leadoff third baseman Maikel Garcia, resulting in the second out of the inning. The Mariners were one out away from holding a share of first place in their division. They hadn't done this in 20 years. The crowd was a sellout. Everyone was waiting for this moment. Muñoz now had to face young Royals phenom Bobby Witt Jr., though he opted to intentionally walk him. The last man standing between the Seattle Mariners and first place was pinch-hitter Freddy Fermin. Muñoz began with a fastball down the middle of the plate. Strike one. The next pitch was way inside, a sinker, called ball one. Pitch number 3 was a sinker, a middle-low pitch that Fermin fouled off for strike two. Muñoz, who normally had an excellent slider, had been struggling with it lately. Nonetheless, he tried to get Fermin to swing at it for strike three, but Fermin didn't bite as it ended up outside for ball 2. Having thrown two sinkers in this at bat already, Muñoz opted to use that pitch one more time, and it was far inside, but Fermin swung anyway. Strike three, game over. Despite being 7.5 games back just ten days prior, the Seattle Mariners had moved into a tie for first place in the division.\n\nWhile they would take sole possession of first just two days later, they did not hold onto the division lead. The Seattle Mariners, Houston Astros, and Texas Rangers all took turns in first place for varying periods over the next several weeks. While the teams not in first were in good position for a wild card, the Toronto Blue Jays were threatening for a spot as well, and with either the Tampa Bay Rays or Baltimore Orioles all but locks for the first wild card, that left those 4 teams for the 3 spots in the postseason. All we can do now, is watch."

		"notes": "In the month since the last game I attended, the playoff picture was becoming clearer. Unfortunately, the Mariners division lead did not last, and they found themselves with a far more realistic shot at a wild card spot than a division title. But even then, their shot at a wild card spot no longer felt realistic. The final 10 stretch of games, which included 3 in Texas, 3 vs Houston, and now 4 vs Texas, had started almost as poorly as possible. They got swept aside in Texas, managing only 1 win in 6 games there this season. Despite already clinching the tiebreaker over Houston in August, they lost 2 of 3 against them at home when it mattered most. I pretty much knew their playoff chances were over after Monday's game, when they lost to Justin Verlander after Luis Castillo had an absolutely atrocious start when he was needed most. While Tuesday provided a little hope in a 6-2 win, it was even more over after an 8-3 loss on Wednesday, putting them back 1.5 games of Houston and 4 of Texas with only 4 more games to play. They managed to scrape together a win on Thursday night, with J.P. Crawford playing hero and walking the Mariners off, after being down 2-1 since the 4th inning. While there was still mathematically a chance that the Mariners could make the postseason, there was absolutely nothing from their play in September (9-16 record by that point) that indicated they were capable of making even a 3-game run. That being said, they were still in it, and had to play as such.\n\nGetting the ball for the Mariners was rookie Bryan Woo, who had a couple poor outings against Texas before. One of those was his major league debut in June, and another being just five days prior to end the series in Texas. With the teams playoff hopes hanging by a thread, he was sorely needed tonight. The first inning went strikeout, walk, strikeout, walk, and strikeout, which was pretty stressful. The second inning was better, with only a single followed by a couple flyouts and a strikeout. The third inning however, he really labored. It began with a single by Marcus Semien, then a walk by Corey Seager. Mitch Garver flew out which moved Semien to third. Adolis Garcia then struck out, but after getting to a 2-2 count on Nathaniel Lowe, Woo hit Lowe, loading up the bases. After getting into a 3-2 count with Josh Jung, Woo coaxed another flyout to snuff out the threat and keep the game scoreless.\n\nWhile many of the Mariners bats had struggled lately, one player in Ty France was beginning to stick out like a sore thumb. He was hitting a lot of ground balls, which is not good for a player with his lack of speed. When he does get base hits, they are usually just singles, but again since he's so slow, he would basically never take the extra base. While he gets on base from a lot of hit by pitches, they're often on his wrist, leading to potential injuries, further worsening his hitting ability. Despite all of these obvious flaws in his game, Ty France did the unthinkable and lead off the bottom of the third with a home run, his first in well over a month. After a groundout by Jarred Kelenic, trade deadline acquisition Josh Rojas hit a home run of his own. Eugenio Suarez, another struggling Mariners hitter, doubled in J.P. Crawford a few batters later. Thanks to Bryan Woo's tremendous efforts to keep the Rangers off the board, the Mariners now had a 3-0 lead.\n\nWoo began the 4th with another flyout, and then a groundout. While by this point he had only logged 3.2 innings, he had thrown 82 bullets, many of them high-stress. Local product Tayler Saucedo came in to relieve him of his duties, getting a strikeout to end the inning. The Mariners offense picked up right where it left off, beginning with a single from Teoscar Hernandez, a walk from Mike Ford, and Ty France getting yet <i>another</i> hit by pitch. This loaded the bases for Jarred Kelenic, who struck out on the 7th pitch of the at bat. While they had a 3-0 lead, the Mariners could not afford to blow a bases loaded no out opportunity, like they had so many times this season. Up next was Josh Rojas, who once again delivered with a single to move everyone up a base, scoring the Mariners 4th run. The Rangers opted to go to their bullpen at this point, taking out Nathan Eovaldi, who had thrown 80 pitches himself. Up next was last night's hero, J.P. Crawford, and he delivered yet again, this time with a grand slam to double the Mariners lead to 8-0.\n\nIn an ideal world, this would be the dagger in the Rangers heart, the final blow that would have hopefully put the Mariners in a great spot for a postseason berth. But this was not an ideal world. Not because the Mariners didn't win, you can see clearly from the final score that it ended at 8-0, but for the reasons mentioned at the start of this entry. Being too many games out with too few left to play. By not playing well over the final month, and even worse in this final stretch of games against the teams you were competing against for a spot. They controlled their own destiny. But if you don't play well enough, it doesn't matter.\n\nDespite the Mariners win tonight, tomorrow was a different story. While the Mariners ace Luis Castillo took the mound, his start was even worse than the one against the Astros earlier in the week. He had no control, and walked 5 guys, yielding 4 runs and not even making it out of the 3rd inning. He had made it through at least 5 innings in every start this year, until now. The Mariners went on to lose this game 6-1, and in the process, allowed the Rangers to clinch a postseason spot on the Mariners home field. After the game, Rangers shortstop Corey Seager was interviewed, and commented how great it was to play for a team that was willing to spend and get the pieces necessary to take the next step. Every Mariners fan knew this was a shot at the Mariners, who had missed out on many free agents that would have helped them immensely. Not to mention the Mariners employed Corey Seager's brother Kyle, who played for the Mariners for a decade, and had a very poor relationship with Jerry Dipoto near the end. He had been vocal about the teams' refusal to commit to winning.\n\nWhile the Rangers win didn't knock the Mariners out of postseason contention, the Astros win down in Arizona did. For the 4th time in the last 10 years, the Mariners had been eliminated from postseason contention in either game 161 or 162. Only one team had even experienced this fate more than once. While the Mariners managed to win on the final day of the season, it was completely pointless for them. Ironically enough, it prevented the Rangers from winning the division, which the Astros took yet again by virtue of a tiebreaker. While the Astros made it to the championship series for the 2nd year in a row, it was the Rangers that beat them to the pennant. Despite losing all 3 games at home, they took all 4 games in Houston, winning the series in 7 games. If that wasn't enough, the Rangers followed that up by winning their first ever World Series in 5 games versus the underdog Arizona Diamondbacks. With the Diamondbacks making it to the Fall Classic, that marked the third year in a row that the National League pennant winner had a worse record than the Mariners. However, the Rangers World Series championship was a much bigger deal with regards to the Mariners. The Rangers had finished with 102 losses in 2021, the same year the Mariners won 90 games for the first time in almost twenty years. Yet just two years later, the Rangers catapulted to that same 90-72 record the 2021 Mariners had, winning the whole thing while the Mariners took a step back to finish with just 88 wins.\n\nMany Mariners fans were upset at the conclusion of the season with how it ended. Even the players were outspoken at the need of big names on the team. Starting catcher Cal Raleigh, who played almost every game in September, spoke after Saturday's game that the team needed to go out and get big name pitchers and big name hitters so the team could take the next step. Despite apologizing the next morning before the season's finale, a few other players, namely Ty France, J.P. Crawford and Logan Gilbert all came out in support of Raleigh and agreed with his sentiment after the final game ended. Despite finally ending the drought in 2022, it was clear that wasn't enough, nor should it be. We had been told that this team would be competitive year after year, and while they were indeed competitive, it feels like almost everything needs to go right for this team to even make it. Compare that to the Rangers, who had many injuries and an atrocious bullpen, and <i>still</i> managed to not just make it, but win it all. The Mariners once again have the most important offseason in recent memory in front of them, and it's time to spend now more than ever."
