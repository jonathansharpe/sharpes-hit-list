			<h2 id='research-question'>Refined Research Question</h2>
			<p><b>How does the elevation of a Major League Baseball stadium affect the air resistance on the baseball?</b></p>
			<p>There are 30 stadiums in Major League Baseball, each with slightly different environments. It's pretty common knowledge that the ball flies farther in Colorado, since Coors Field is almost a mile above sea level. As a Mariners fan, I also know that the ball tends to lose height quickly near the wall, resulting in many balls that looked like home runs landing in an outfielders glove. While elevation is likely to be a factor here, there are other environmental effects to consider, such as temperature and relative location to water.</p>
			<h2 id='empirical-data'>Empirical Data</h2>
			<p>The site that I'll be pulling this data from is <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com">Baseball Savant</a>, which is an amazing website that shows many advanced statistics to better understand and evaluate player performance. In 2015, Major League Baseball introduced StatCast, which was a new way to measure previously unknown stats, such as launch angle, exit velocity, and even better projected home run distances. Baseball Savant is the way to access this data. Anyone can easily look up many advanced statistics, such as average batted ball exit velocity for hitters, and whiff (swing and miss) percentage for pitchers. On Baseball Savant, there is a page titled "Park Factors", which compares the 30 stadiums with varying metrics. You can sort the parks by "Variable Extra Distance", or in other words, roughly how much farther the ball travels by number of feet. Here is the table. Most data is copied from Baseball Savant, but I also got the average yearly humidity for each city the teams play in. These numbers are from the 2021 season.</p>

			<p>So at first glance, one can see that elevation isn't the sole factor in determining how far balls will fly. While the top two parks in elevation are also the top two parks in feet added, number 3 in elevation is way down at 8 for feet added. There's also a clear outlier with Tropicana Field at 4 despite being only 15 feet above sea level. We might think that this answers our question, that elevation <i>sometimes</i> affects the air resistance. Or maybe just that there are other factors affecting air resistance, besides just the elevation. To better answer this question, let's look a little more into the data on the other environmental effects.</p>
		<h2 id="equations">Equations, Graphs, Representations and Analysis</h2>
		<p>Let's look at some equations. Air resistance is also known as "drag force", measured in Newtons. The equation to find the force of air resistance, is one half the density (of the air) times the velocity of the object squared, times the drag coefficient times the cross-sectional area. </p>
		<span class="math inline">\(F_D=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 C_D A\)</span>
		<p>So this makes it quite clear that air resistance is what affects the flight of the baseball, and the air resistance is affected by the air density, which varies depending on multiple conditions. One of those is humidity, which is affected based on proximity to water. Humidity was featured in the table above, but here is a feet added vs humidity graph to better illustrate the difference.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/humidity-vs-feet.png" alt="humidty-vs-feet.png">
		<p>Based on this graph, there is very little relation of humidity and extra feet traveled. It goes back and forth a lot, and the only obvious consistency is that the top two parks are the same on both lists.</p>
		<p>Okay, so humidity is not something that hugely impacts the drag on a baseball, at least not on its own. How about elevation? We know that atmospheric pressure decreases with elevation, thereby decreasing air density.</p>
		<span class="math inline">\(p=p_0*(1-\frac{L*h}{T_0})^{\frac{g*M}{R_0*L}}\)</span>
		<p>This equation has a lot of constants; <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> represents the height above Earth's surface; <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span> represents the sea level standard atmospheric pressure; <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> represents the temperature lapse rate for dry air; <span class="math inline">\(c_p\)</span> represents the constant-pressure specific heat; <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> represents the Earth's gravitational constant; <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> represents the molar mass of dry air; and <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> represents the universal gas constant. All of these represent unchanged constants, with the <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> being whatever number we plug in. Here's a graph comparing elevation to the feet added.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/elevation-vs-feet.png" alt="humidty-vs-feet.png">
		<p>Wait, this doesn't look very helpful either. Again, the two parks Chase Field and Coors Field are standouts, but the rest don't follow a clear trend. Just like the previous graph, the numbers go up and down. However, there are some common traits among specific data points. The dip on the right half of the graph at 815 is Target Field in Minneapolis, which has a colder average temperature than other places. The bigger dip at 600 is Comerica Park in Detroit, which also has a lower average temperature. The two spikes on the left half are Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg Florida at 15, and Globe Life Field in Arlington at 545 feet. The former has a fixed roof, and the latter a retractable roof that is closed most of the time, both of which allow for a climate-controlled environment. The two dips at 595 are the two Chicago stadiums, Guaranteed Rate Field and Wrigley Field. It's common knowledge that Chicago is known as the Windy City, and Wrigley can get especially windy at times. So while this graph doesn't give much information on its own, considering more data will give more significance to it. With the mention about temperature, let's look at a temperature vs. feet added graph to see if there's more of a correlation there.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/temperature-vs-feet.png" alt="humidty-vs-feet.png">
		<p>It looks like there's finally somewhat of a trend. Most of the parks that have the ball travel less far than average are on the lower end of the temperature, and the higher temperature ones generally have the ball travel farther. While it's not a perfectly linear graph, that at least is clear. The two outliers on the left half are Tropicana Field and Globe Life Field again, which we've already addressed. However, the dips in the graph near the end are interesting. The dip at 77.6 is Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, which has a very low 3.7 feet fewer than average for travel of the baseball. The elevation is quite low, at only 35 feet above sea level, so this might explain the dip.</p>
		<p>However, this whole thing started about a question regarding elevation. But we learned that elevation doesn't matter as much as temperature does when measuring how much farther the ball will travel on average. Let's look at a temperature vs elevation graph, to see if there's a correlation.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/temperature-vs-elevation.png" alt="humidty-vs-feet.png">
		<p>Well, it doesn't look like there's an obvious correlation between elevation and temperature. This makes sense, given that cities closer to the water will have a milder climate than cities farther inland. With all this said, there is one more thing in Baseball Savant's table that I haven't addressed yet.</p>
		<p>There is another column labeled "Environment", which in the description, explains that it encompasses everything otherwise not captured, such as humidity, wind patterns, and more. We've already addressed humidity, and though I didn't make a graph for it, I've mentioned wind when talking about the Chicago stadiums.</p>
		<p>Let's go back to the equation on the drag force. The key to this equation is the variable <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, which represents the air density. The humidity affects air density, as water is denser than air. So if there are more water particles in the air, the air is of course going to be denser. Also, having an external force on the baseball in the form of wind will of course also affect the flight of the baseball, by helping or hindering it's flight path.</p>
		<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
		<p>So what can we conclude from this data? To answer our original question, elevation does in fact affect air resistance on the baseball. Air density is lower at higher elevations. However, since most stadiums don't have high elevations, and have more significant other environmental effects, elevation doesn't play much of a role once you factor those elements in. The only two stadiums where it plays a significant role are probably Chase Field and Coors Field. They have the perfect storm of environments; low humidity, and high elevation. In fact, it's such a perfect storm that both teams have instituted a humidor in which to store the baseballs that are used during the game. The humidor is a humid room that's meant to get the balls more damp to decrease distance. It didn't take long for Coors to add one, (2002, opened 1995) but only recently has Chase added theirs (2018, opened 1998). While it has made a difference, the environmental effects are too significant to fully neutralize. As we've seen, the parks are 1 and 2 on extra feet traveled.</p>
