This game was honestly not that interesting, as the Mariners didn't do
much with the bats and the pitching was lackluster as well. We managed
to see Taijuan Walker start yet <i>another</i> game, though this would
be the last one since he was traded in the offseason. Probably the
only noteworthy thing about this game was that we sat very close to
the field, behind home plate.
