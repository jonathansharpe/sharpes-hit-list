Another Friday game right before the All Star break, almost exactly 2
years to the day to the one in 2017 (also against the A's). The seats
I had in this game were probably my favorite of any game I've been to.
We sat along the third base line, and had a great view of the field.
Unfortunately, there wasn't anything super interesting in this one,
except that Austin Nola pinch hit, and made his first professional
appearance in left field! I looked this up while we were there, and
was surprised to see that was the case. Nola ended up playing most of
the season at first base, and became the starting catcher the next
season with Tom Murphy injured.
