This was the first game I went to with just friends! One of my friends
got tickets, and so there were 4 of us who went to the game. We
heckled Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt for some reason, don't
know why. Unfortunately this game wasn't all that interesting from a
baseball perspective, but at least we had fun.
