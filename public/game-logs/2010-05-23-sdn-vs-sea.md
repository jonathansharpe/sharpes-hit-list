The oldest game on this site had been the July 4th 2012 game for the
longest time. While I knew I'd been at games before then, I didn't
remember enough to pinpoint the exact days I went. Among some of the
vague memories I had, I remember my dad taking pictures of Ken Griffey
Jr. at one game, anticipating his retirement, given his old age and
severely declining production.

Recently, I was tasked with cleaning out an old hard drive my dad used
to store mostly pictures. Out of curiosity, I skimmed through them to
see if I could find anything interesting, and I did. I found those
pictures of Jr. taken all those years ago. One of them showed that
they were playing the Padres, that the catcher was Nick Hundley, and
that it very much looked like a day game. I then nailed down that the
day was Ken Griffey Jr.'s final start in the major leagues, May 23rd,
2010

His next game wasn't until May 31st, when he pinch-hit for catcher Rob
Johnson, and managed to reach base on a fielder's choice out. He was
then pinch ran for rookie Michael Saunders. That evening, he drove out
of Seattle, and told no one. It turned out that he was retiring from
baseball.

So while he didn't do much of anything at the plate, I can still claim
that I saw Jr.'s final start, for what it's worth.
