For the longest time, this was the first game on the site. While it's
the first game I remember going to after I really got interested in
baseball, it was definitely not the first I ever attended; just the
first one I had concrete evidence for having attended. After finding
some old pictures, I added a game from 2010, and I may be able to add
more games before that if I can find proof. This is when the logs
begin with a more firsthand account of what actually happened, but the
logs don't get extremely detailed until the 2020s or so.

Hector Noesi went into this game with a 2-10 record and a 5.69 ERA.
That trend continued as he gave up 4 runs in 5 innings, which was
enough for an opponent facing the 2012 Mariners. They managed to score
2 in the bottom of the 9th, but Miguel Olivo's flyout to right to end
the game was just too short. We sat in the right field seats for the
first time.
