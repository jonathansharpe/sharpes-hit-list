This was the 4th home opener I had made it to, and this game was
coming off the heels of a 1-6 road trip to start the season, including
a 7-run 9th inning comeback by the Angels the day before to turn what
looked like a 9-3 Mariners victory into a 10-9 Angels win. Needless to
say, the Mariners really needed this game, and they got it, thanks to
James Paxton throwing 7 shutout innings. The Mariners also hit a
little bit, scoring 6 runs. Recent acquisition Mitch Haniger continued
his hot hitting, though shortstop Jean Segura, acquired in the same
deal, left due to an injury and landed on the disabled list the next
day. Despite that, it was a good win for the M's.
