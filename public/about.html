			<h1 class="px-4 pt-4">About</h1>
			<p class="px-4 pb-4">This website is currently a place for me to host information about the Major League Baseball games I've attended. However, I want to also make this a showcase of my programming skills.</p>
			<h1 class="px-4 pt-4">Projects</h1>
			<p class="px-4 pb-4">This is the main project that I've worked on, but another one was my senior software engineering project at Seattle Pacific University. I worked in a team with 5 other people to put together a replacement for SPU's student course planning, student class registration, time schedule, and suggested course sequences into one integrated web app. Here is a link to that web app: <a href="https://witty-pond-04abab51e.3.azurestaticapps.net/ ">click here</a></p>
