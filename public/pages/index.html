			</div>
			<p class="p-4">This is my baseball website, which currently is a database of all the baseball games I've attended in person. While a couple pages are finished, the site as a whole is still in development, and I'm interested to see what other content I can add to improve the site. It is written in HTML and CSS, with Bootstrap as a framework. I also use JavaScripb for generating the list of games for example.</p>
			<h2 class="px-4">Home Page</h2>
			<p class="px-4 pb-4">What you're looking at! Currently used as an overview of what all the pages are for, might change in the future.</p>
			<h2 class="px-4">Games Attended</h2>
			<p class="px-4 pb-4">This is the page with all the data. There are collapsible lists of each year, housing the games I've gone to. Each game has the final score, a picture representing the location, and a link to the boxscore on baseball-reference.com. There's also a slide-out panel with some game notes. These detail the experience, along with any significant happenings at that game. You may notice the game notes get more detailed as time goes on, mostly because I became more attentive to each game, and my local team, the Seattle Mariners, became more interesting to watch.</p>
			<h2 class="px-4">Teams Seen</h2>
			<p class="px-4 pb-4">This page puts the teams in a nicely organized list, with dropdown lists showing what games I've been to involving that team. One goal is to see all 30 MLB teams, which seems very doable, as I'm now only missing 5, all in the National League.</p>
			<h2 class="px-4">Ballpark Pages</h2>
			<p class="px-4 pb-4">I have a page for each ballpark I've been to. It goes over the details of what each ballpark has, how the experience is, and more. Sort of a ballpark review/overview, if you will.</p>
			<h2 class="px-4">Tier List</h2>
			<p class="px-4 pb-4">I'm going to rank all the ballparks I've been to, with little snippets about why I placed them there.</p>
			<h2 class="px-4">Future Plans</h2>
			<p class="px-4 pb-4">I will improve the site performance and appearance, as well as add new pages as I go. Keep checking back for more!</p>
