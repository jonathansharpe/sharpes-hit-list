They managed to score 2 in the bottom of the 9th, but Miguel Olivo's flyout to right to end the game was just too short. We sat in the right field seats for the first time."

I don't remember the game being super interesting from a neutral fan perspective; it was mostly about seeing Wrigley Field for the first time. The park had interesting scoreboards under the upper deck, so you could see them if you were sitting in the far back rows of the main level. Also, unlike every other park I've visited to date, you couldn't walk all the way around the stadium without temporarily leaving the stadium. The main concourse, which involved all seating in foul territory, was separated from the outfield bleachers."

This park reminded me of Safeco Field (now T-Mobile Park) in that the upper deck had a very similar feel. The concourse was also kinda similar if I remember correctly.\nSimilar to Wrigley, this park had some slightly outdated elements including a couple large dot-matrix scoreboards. Safeco Field had a smaller one up through 2012, but each one the White Sox had was bigger on its own than the one the Mariners had. The video scoreboard was also much smaller than the one in Seattle, and pretty low-res. Like Wrigley, it gave a retro vibe to the experience, but from a different era; Wrigley was more like the 1950s or 60s, with U.S. Cellular more like 80s and 90s with the dot-matrix scoreboards; I liked it. I took a walk around the main concourse, which was neat. It was later in the game, so it was dark and cool, one of my favorite parts of baseball games; when it has cooled down and the lights are taking full effect. I also liked the pseudo wall that surrounds the concourse. The White Sox launch fireworks after each home run, which I thought was neat. The Mariners had not started doing that at this point.\n The Royals were in the wild card hunt at this point, and ended up securing their spot I think the next night. The White Sox were stuck in their phase of mediocrity, which they wouldn't really leave until late 2016 and 2017 when the rebuild was a full go. While U.S. Cellular/Guaranteed Rate Field is not rated very highly, I enjoyed my time there and would like to revisit, which shouldn't be too hard since I'm already planning on revisiting Wrigley."

However, at this point in the season, Trevor Rosenthal was still their closer, despite pitching quite poorly to that point. I was optimistic the Mariners could score off him, and they certainly did that, with an Adam Lind walk-off 3-run home run. A really exciting end to the game, after it honestly being quite boring to that point."

He started the 8th inning, but the wheels fell off and the Mariners took advantage. Mike Zunino led off the inning with a home run. Guillermo Heredia, recent Triple-A callup, got his first major-league hit and RBI to get the Mariners their second run. Then a few hitters later, Robinson Cano hit a 3 run BOMB to our section in right field to give the Mariners a 5-4 lead. In fact, if you look at video of the home run he hit, you can see my dad and I in the frame! \nThis dramatic comeback was followed with Edwin Diaz, young flamethrower getting his first career save after being given the closers job starting that evening. Weirdly enough, the winning pitcher in this game, reliever Donn Roach, also won the walk-off game in June. These were the only two wins Roach got that year, and he only pitched in 4 games with the Mariners. Easily the best game I had been to at this point in the season."

		"notes": "This was the fourth stadium I'd visited. I didn't have super high expectations or anything, but this is a fantastic ballpark. While being one of the newest parks in MLB, it manages to have an old-school intimate feel. This is probably because the ballpark was built in a very tiny footprint. Despite that, the park had incredibly wide concourses, wide enough to have separate smaller kiosks (unlike T-Mobile Park, for example). \nThe upper deck is what I've started referring to as a \"split-level\", in that the sight lines from the concourse of the field are almost uninterrupted throughout. This is different from T-Mobile Park for example, where the only sight lines onto the field involve looking through the tunnel, and even those aren't great. Hopefully I'm explaining this well. Either way, it's a great feature to have, as it makes being in the upper deck much more palatable, and makes you feel closer to the action. Our seats were in the main level, which is also somewhat split, as there's a walkway between the closer and farther away sections. The seats were very good, although we totally forgot about sunscreen, and got very sunburned on our legs in the 90-degree Minnesota heat.\nThe game itself was pretty interesting, since the Royals' center fielder Paulo Orlando ended up a triple short of the cycle. This was also during Twins' second baseman Brian Dozier's incredible 2016 second half, and he hit one of his 28 post All-Star Break home runs. He ended up hitting 42 for the season, setting a new record for a second baseman in the American League. \nWhile as a neutral fan, I wanted to see the Twins win (as the home team), this was still a great experience, despite the sunburns."

		"notes": "Wow, this one was probably the most interesting game I'd been to, yet most of the interesting stuff happened after we left. First of all, there was a portable National Baseball Hall of Fame exhibit setup, so we spent some time there. We got done there early, and for some reason the gates at Kauffman Stadium don't open until an hour and a half or so before first pitch, which is much later than other parks I've been to; the norm is usually 2 hours. We were waiting in the muggy mid-August heat, though we did know that thunderstorms were in the forecast and were almost certainly going to cause a rain delay.\nFirst of all, the ballpark. Kauffman Stadium is extremely unique, in that it was built in a time of multipurpose stadiums galore. Virtually every other team was building a multipurpose stadium in the 60s and 70s, and the baseball-only stadium didn't come back into vogue until the early 90s with the opening of Camden Yards in Baltimore. It did feel a bit old, but that was probably because I had come from a stadium almost 40 years newer in Target Field. The park only has an upper deck in the foul area, so the outfield seating is just a lower deck and a concourse, though there are the recognizable fountains. The scoreboard is really cool, as it's in the shape of a crown yet still captures all the necessary information. The staff seemed really nice, there were at least a few ushers who said \"Hello and welcome to The K!\"\nThe beginning of the game was rather unassuming. Brian Dozier hit another home run, which was neat. However, at around the bottom of the 4th inning we knew it was only a matter of time until the storm came. The Royals were leading 4-1 at that point. If they could complete the top of the 5th inning with a lead, they would win the game if they couldn't resume the game that night. However, the Twins tied the game at 4, and almost directly after, the game entered a rain delay. Fans stormed out of the stadium, including my dad and I, since we had an early flight the next morning and couldn't stick around. Getting out was a little bit of a nightmare, since everyone was trying to leave at once. One car in front of us even hit another car, and stopped one of the two outgoing lanes of traffic. This ended our experience there, but the game itself still had a lot left.\nDuring the rain delay, some young kids started running around the concourse, just as a way to entertain themselves, and this got on the broadcast. Eventually, the game did resume. However, there was ANOTHER delay, this time because half the lights in the stadium went out! That's not something you see at all. After that delay was done, they played on. The game even went extra innings, and the Royals walked it off in the bottom of the 11th inning. The game ended at 2:15 AM. With us getting up around 4 to leave, it was a good idea that we didn't stick around.\nIn summary, a very interesting and very weird game. I'd really like to go back to Kauffman, so I can get a full game experience, because it was a nice park and I wanted to be there longer."

While I was hoping for that, the Mariners would settle for a double, which scored pinch-runner Tyler Smith from second.

While the Mariners were basically eliminated from the postseason race at this point, I was still excited for this game as it was my first time going to Fan Appreciation Night, which is always the last Friday game of the year.\nThe Indians were pretty fresh off their modern record 22-game win streak, and so this was a tall task for the Mariners. However, Erasmo Ramirez of all people rose to the occasion, throwing 8 innings of 1-run ball, one of the best outings from a Mariner starting pitcher in months. Knowing that the Mariners had the top of the lineup coming to the plate in the bottom of the 9th, I was confident they'd win the game, and they did! Nelson Cruz hit a walk-off 2-run home run off Cleveland closer Cody Allen. A good win for the Mariners."

This was our 2nd Opening Day, which in my opinion is always more exciting than just a home opener. The Mariners faced the Indians again, and though slightly controversially, Felix Hernandez was given the ball. At this point James Paxton was clearly the better pitcher, though he didn't start Opening Day, and never would in a Mariners uniform.\nFelix pitched pretty well, allowing no runs over 5.1 innings, his 2nd shortest Opening Day start; his shortest was the year prior in Houston, going only 5 innings. The Mariners were facing reigning Cy Young winner Corey Kluber, who gave up 2 runs in the first inning, and somehow that's all the Mariners would need, despite Kluber throwing an 8-inning complete game! A good Opening Day win for the Mariners."

The Mariners continued to see Angels starter Andrew Heaney well, as both Cruz and Ryon Healy tagged him in the bottom of the 4th to end his night. While Trout did hit a second home run, that wasn't enough as the Mariners held on and won 5-3. This actually put the Mariners up half a game above the Astros in the division standings, but that didn't last too long. A good win for the Mariners."

Marco Gonzales threw an absolute gem, and was a strike away from a shutout after going 1-2 to Mike Moustakas before giving up an RBI single. He got the next hitter out and finished the game for his first MLB complete game. All around a great game for the Mariners."

The Red Sox became the 4th team I've seen home and away (Cubs, Royals, Twins), a list that still unfortunately excludes the Mariners. \nenway Park was amazing! I currently have it in the S-tier of my ballparks tier list. When I visited, it was my favorite park, but since every trip has resulted in me finding a new favorite, I've decided to use a tier list rather than a numbered list since the best parks are all so close. \nThere was a serious chance that the game would be postponed, as thunderstorms were rampant before the game. The start time was delayed from 7:10 to around 7:45, but the whole game was played with no more delays. There was some rain during the game, but it wasn't bad. \nOur seats were in Loge Box 118, which is basically a regular section cut in half, then cut in half again with a pole separating two rows of 4 seats. You don’t have to climb over as many people to get to your seat, making it very easy to get in and out of your seat during the game. I don’t know how many other teams have this, but I will definitely be on the lookout for box seating like this in future stadiums, and hopefully the Mariners add this someday.\nWe flew in on a red-eye flight the night before, and I was running on about 2 hours of sleep. I was extremely tired in the 5th or 6th inning, and was kept awake by some Pepsi. We left in the middle of the 8th inning, after they played Sweet Caroline, a Fenway Park tradition. As I said before, a fantastic balllpark and a fantastic experience. The only strange thing was that they served hot dogs in bread! Don't know what that was about."

Yankee Stadium II was very generic and uninteresting, and is the first and so far only park I don't have a desire to go back to. Local fans we talked to seem to agree that Fenway Park is superior and the new Yankee Stadium is not as good as the old one, even though the old one wasn't original from 1976-2008.\nWe sat in our seats in right-center field for about 2 innings, then got up and walked around because it was 97 degrees and the heat was unbearable. We walked through Monument Park, which was neat, and we saw the museum with a bunch of the World Series trophies and history, which was also neat. Like Target Field, the upper deck was also a \"split-level\", which was one of the actually good qualities of the park.In my opinion, the architects didn't do a good enough job of copying the design of the old park. My dad said it was almost like an amusement park version, and I'd agree. I'm overall disappointed with the stadium, especially compared to what they were basing it after."

The ball was hit at 107 MPH, and had a 74% hit probability, making what would have been an amazing moment a tough luck out. However, Mallex Smith followed with a base hit to win the game. \nThe game was followed by a Hall of Fame-themed fireworks show celebrating Edgar Martinez's induction to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. We sat in the LF bleachers for the first time since Opening Day 2015, and they now had padded backrests! Before, there were literally just the metal benches to sit on, if I remember correctly.

I went to the game with two friends I had just met, including my friend Andrew. This was obviously our first game together, but would be far from the last. \nDespite going to many home openers and a few Opening Days to this point, this was my first time seeing the final game of the season. After every final home game of the season, the Mariners players stick around and toss out extra giveaways they had, and they did the same here. Unfortunately, we didn't get any. Mariners center fielder Kyle Lewis was taking pictures with fans, and I probably would have gotten one if he had stuck around a few more minutes. \nKyle Seager homered, Kyle Lewis got an RBI. Pretty good way to end the season. This ended up being the last game I went to for 550 days, because of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in no attendance for the entire Mariners 2020 season."

Since that game in 2019 was the day before college classes started, this was the first game I attended while in college! Capacity was limited to 9000 fans for the first two homestands, and this one was reported as a sellout. Masks and social distancing will be a thing. \nMariners were down early, 5-1 after 7 innings. They came back with 6 runs in the bottom of the 8th to take a 7-6 lead, including an error on a throw by Brandon Belt to Brandon Crawford, two guys who have played together forever, to give the Mariners the lead. The Giants came back with a pinch-hit home run by Alex Dickerson in the top of the 9th. Mariners walked it off in the 10th off of 3 straight walks by Jose Alvarez, and due to the runner on 2nd that’s all they needed. The end was very influenced by both the three batter minimum rule and the runner on 2nd in extras rule, probably the most I'd seen of any game since the either rule was instituted. The crowd was great despite capacity limitations, and since everyone was spread out it was plenty loud. Another excellent Opening Day for the Mariners."

Jake Odorizzi had a rough first inning, throwing almost 40 pitches, though only allowed 1 run in that inning. Nick Margevicius pitched well, though had to leave due to arm fatigue in the 5th inning. The bullpen really picked him up, allowing no hits the rest of the game, and Marge only allowed one, resulting in a combined one-hitter! The Mariners broke out the bats in the bottom of the 5th, scoring 4 runs and taking a lead they wouldn’t give back. \nThis was the largest win margin to this point in the season, at 5 runs, and therefore their first “blowout” win by Baseball-Reference’s standards. The weather was super nice, an impossible mid-70s day in April. As a result Andrew and I both got sunburned on our arms. The boos were also VERY loud, since this was the first series the Astros played in Seattle with fans after the 2017 cheating scandal came to light in late 2019/early 2020. Since we sat in the left field bleachers, there was also a lot of heckling aimed at the Astros left fielder, Chas McCormick, despite the fact that he made his MLB debut in 2021 and had nothing to do with the scandal. There was a legendary group of hecklers behind us that were going at it most of the game, and was by far the most heckling I’d ever heard. Overall fantastic experience, though sunscreen is a must for future day Mariners games."

Chris Flexen had a tough outing, but managed to make it through 4 innings giving up only 3 runs. Shohei Ohtani hit a home run, but I missed it because I was looking at my phone unfortunately. \nFor the first inning, I predicted that Trout and Haniger would both homer, Haniger more specifically on the first pitch. He did in fact hit a leadoff home run, first of the year, but it was not off the first pitch. Fortunately Trout did not homer in the first. It was a beautiful night for baseball, if a bit cold later on. There was an annoying heckler who was yelling stuff off and on. \nWith it being the last day of April, in the middle of the 8th inning, they played the song “It’s Gonna Be Me”, but the “me” sounds like “May” so that’s the text that was on the electronic scoreboards. But they didn't stop there, as they played it after the Mariners hitters got on base, scored a couple runs, AND during the pitching change, and it was hilarious. \nMariners bullpen came in clutch once again, as the Angels ceased to score after the 3rd until the 9th inning, where they just got 1 off of Rafael Montero. Struggling hitters Dylan Moore and Tom Murphy both homered and got other RBI hits, which was big for both of them. Overall great game to go to, especially since the Mariners lost big, 10-5 the next night. Andrew wasn’t super jazzed about it, but we still had a fun time."

The concourses were neat, and interestingly enough the bottom ones seemed more updated than the top ones. We went to the 4th deck to get a picture, which was a very cool view. The bleacher area was also really cool, and there were plenty of places to walk around. I got autographs from Manny Mota and Steve Yeager. Yeager mentioned that he played in Seattle in his final year, and told me to enjoy my time in California (spoiler: I did). \nThe food selection was off the charts, and while T-Mobile Park might have more variety, all the options at Dodger Stadium made a lot of sense for baseball. There were BBQs, Dodger Dogs, garlic fries, burgers, ice cream, nachos, street tacos, and more. I went with a Dodger Dog, which were decent, but the fries were good and they had Coke products. Also got the obligatory soft serve helmet cup. Overall probably the best experience I've ever had at a baseball game. Dodger Stadium fits nicely into my S-tier of ballparks, and could easily be my favorite. I'm trying to fight recency bias since it's been 2 years since my visit to Fenway Park.

They had some live music beyond the batters eye in center field, as well as a grass lawn called the “Park at the Park” which looked like a neat hangout space; it was full when we got into the park. \nLike Dodger Stadium, this park had the odds on one side and the evens on the other side, so our section was somewhat easier to find I guess. This new number system is growing on me but still a little weird. I got ice cream here too, though I think the Dodger Stadium stuff was better. They also had Coca-Cola products, and I got another souvenir cup, and remembered it this time (I forgot it at Dodger Stadium!). \ns for the game itself, the Dbacks starter struggled HARD, and was walking everyone. The Padres scored 5 runs in the 2nd, but that was all they’d get for the entire game. The Padres gave it back up, and the go-ahead run was driven in by...the winning pitcher, who was also a reliever!! He also stole 2nd, which added to the weirdness. The first, and probably the last time I’ll see a relief pitcher hit the go-ahead RBI in a game. We sat in the upper deck, which by default were the worst seats we had, but they weren’t bad or anything. Overall good experience, though might not crack the top tier with the Dodger Stadiums and Fenway Parks of the world."

It was honestly not as bad as I thought it would be. \nThere were 3 things that were not great compared to every other stadium though. The first was that they didn’t have Coca-Cola, or Pepsi, but RC COLA. Never seen any other park have this, and I don’t expect to see it ever again. Second, the bathrooms had troughs instead of urinals, which I was concerned about once I realized Wrigley, another old stadium, had them in 2014. Lastly, Andrew ordered pizza, and waited for 40 mins for them to text him it was ready. Then he went over to see what was up, and they said they didn’t have the ability to text him that it was ready, despite the app saying it would. So those three things were easily surpassed by every other stadium I’ve been to. \nHowever, it was kinda cool being in a “concrete jungle” stadium. The 2nd concourse was absolutely dead, but the main concourse was poppin’. What was interesting was while they had ramps, the other way to get up was to get to the 100 level concourse, then go up to the 200 level sections. From the 200 level, you could either go back down using those same stairs, or go up the stairs to the 200 level concourse. From there you could go to the 300 level seats. So it was the first stadium I’d been to (to my knowledge) where you could access all the decks just by going throughout the sections. I took some pictures on the top deck, which was honestly pretty neat. There is something really satisfying about the circular nature of the stadium, despite it being outdated and surpassed. Our seats were pretty decent, though they didn’t feel as close to the 200 level seats in SF. Overall decent to good experience, and I would honestly rather go here again than Yankee Stadium."

It was a very intimate feel, which was amazing I thought. \nWe had some fun beyond center field in a relatively new “party deck” area, and the Dbacks had batting practice. A relief pitcher, Bret de Geus was giving kids baseballs, and one kid gave his bracelet to him as a trade for a ball! Andrew also gave his necklace to him, which was neat. \nThe game was pretty exciting, the Giants took what seemed like a commanding lead before Alex Wood just absolutely lost it in the 6th inning after looking nearly unhittable for the first 5 innings. The Giants took the lead in the 8th, before Jake McGee struggled in the 9th and walked a few guys, which resulted in the Dbacks tying the game. The Giants ended up walking it off, via an error batted by recent acquisition Kris Bryant! Very exciting game, and the park was amazing, a close second to Dodger Stadium.

A nice hat though, very comfortable and looks cool.\nThe food options were less than stellar, but they had a few good ones here and there. We unfortunately sat in front of the scoreboard in right field, so we lost out on the stuff on there, but the left field scoreboard gave most of the information that was out of our view. I went up to the 3rd deck in the later innings to get a picture from the top-most row behind home plate. We got to see Shohei Ohtani, who pitched a great game and lead off the game with a double. Unfortunately that was all he did with the bat, I was hoping for a home run since we were in prime home run territory.

I went to this game with several friends, though this was notably the first game since July of 2019 that I hadn't gone to with Andrew, as he was studying abroad. The game had enormous playoff implications, as the Mariners were tied with the Red Sox for the second wild card spot. The Red Sox played the Nationals, and won, so the Mariners had to win just to keep pace.\nThe crowd was a sellout, the first since Opening Day 2019, which I was also in attendance for. The first inning was great, since Marco cruised through. The Mariners scored what would end up being their only run in the bottom of the 2nd inning. The crowd understandably went wild when that happened. Unfortunately, Marco struggled mightily in the 3rd, giving up 2 runs before recoring an out. While those would be the only two runs he allowed, that proved to be enough as the Mariners offense could just not get anything going that night. They had runners on first and third in the bottom of the 7th with nobody out, and struck out three times to end the inning.\nThe game proved to be very boring, since there was no scoring after the top of the 3rd. I and everyone else in the park was so prepared to get very excited, and that moment just never came. The game was followed by a fireworks show, and we got to sit on the field, which was neat. The grass was so short and the dirt was so well kept that it almost felt fake, like turf. While I was very disappointed after the game, the fireworks show helped a little bit at least. \nUnfortunately, the Mariners did not make it to the playoffs, or even a tiebreaker game. However, they did finish 90-72, blowing their pre-season projections out of the water and surprising everyone. Now that they're not in a rebuilding year, the front office has to show they mean business by helping out this club by signing an infield bat like Marcus Semien, and probably a front-of-the-line starter as well. While the end of the year was disappointing, this definitely feels like just the beginning, unlike 2014, 2016, or 2018. I'm excited to see what the future holds."

To account for that, the first week of games was rescheduled throughout the season, and the first series was moved to the end of the season. As a result, the Mariners opened up on the road in Minnesota and Chicago before coming home to face the Astros for their home opener. It happened to fall on Jackie Robinson Day, which is the first one I've been in attendance for. It was the 75th anniversary of Jackie's debut, and as a result the 42s on everyone's back were in Dodger Blue. I wasn't a huge fan of this, since it seemed to honor the Dodgers for no reason, but it honestly didn't look half bad.\nThe Mariners went out to an early lead, scoring a run in the top of the first, and they could have gotten more. Fortunately, that didn't end up mattering as they had a baserunner on every inning and scored 11 runs. Mariners new leadoff man Adam Frazier had his best night of the young season, with 4 hits and 4RBI, becoming the first Mariner leadoff hitter to do that since Ichiro in 2004. Jesse Winker and Eugenio Suarez, the other two big acquisitions also had great nights, with Suarez's home run capping off the scoring for the Mariners. Marco Gonzales had a great outing, throwing 7 innings of 1-run ball, looking infinitely better than he did in his first outing in Minnesota. While I was near certain Julio Rodriguez was going to hit his first major league home run in this game, he did manage to get a base hit and walk, good steps towards moving his very low average up.\nWith Carlos Correa now in Minnesota, the Astros had 3 hitters (Altuve, Bregman, Gurriel) still left from the 2017 team, and they still absolutely heard it from the fans. In the 8th inning, when the Mariners were already leading 9-1, Altuve came up with two outs and the bases empty, the booing was especially pertinent, and it quickly turned into cheers as Altuve went down on 3 pitches. A really strong way to start out the year at home for the Mariners, as this more than doubled their season-high run total in a game (previous was only 5). While nothing super weird happened like 2021's opening day, this game was nothing but positives for the Mariners."

		"notes": "I went to this game with a couple friends, one of them Andrew, and another Zach for the first time. The Mariners were coming off a 4-game sweep in Boston and a 3-7 road trip. They had been playing very poorly to say the least. This was the Mariners first game against the A's this season, and because of their poor play the Mariners found themselves sharing last place with the A's. The game got off to a slow start, as both pitchers hung up zeros for the first two and a half innings. \nIn the bottom of the first, we were saying that now was a good time for Julio Rodriguez's first home run in Seattle. While he didn't get it in the first, he went deep in the 3rd inning to give the Mariners a 3-0 lead. Unfortunately, Marco Gonzales nearly completely fell apart in the 4th inning, giving up 3 runs and throwing 33 pitches in the inning. The Mariners offense didn't miss a beat as they scored 2 more runs in the bottom of the 4th. To this point, Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh was hitting below .100. Andrew said \"Cal Raleigh hit home run challenge (impossible)\", and shortly after Cal hit a 2-run home run to give the Mariners the lead! \nMarco held the A's off the board and the Mariners scored 2 runs again in the bottom of the 5th. While Eugenio Suarez was up, I said \"homer on the next pitch\" when the count was 2-0. He ended up hitting the home run on a 3-1 but I still kinda called it. At this point the Mariners had a comfortable 7-3 lead, but Marco fell apart again in the 6th. While getting a groundout on the first batter, he gave up two singles which ended his night. Rookie reliever Penn Murfee came in, and while having pitched well to this point was not good here, allowing both inherited runners to score and then one more, trimming the lead to 7-6. Sergio Romo then came in, and managed to get the final two outs without allowing any more runs. \nThe next half inning, Andrew tried the reverse-jinx again by saying \"Cal Raleigh hit a single challenge (impossible)\", and surprisingly the impossible became reality as Cal Raleigh followed his home run up by a single, giving him his first multi-hit game on the season. The scoring was finished after that 6th inning for the A's, and the Mariners managed to clutch out a one-run win, something that has become more difficult this season after being a normality in 2021. Diego Castillo pitched a brilliant 8th inning, striking out the side and giving a glimpse of his return to form. Paul Sewald pitched the 9th, and while he allowed the tying run to make it to scoring position after a single and wild pitch, it would stay there as he got a groundout to Ty France to end the game and seal an important win for the Mariners to start the homestand."
