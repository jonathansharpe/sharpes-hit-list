		<SectionHeader>Introduction</SectionHeader>

		<Paragraph>Baseball has been forever present in my life in one
		way or another. I played little league a few years when I was
		a kid, but most of all, I enjoyed attending Mariners games. At
		some point in 2012, a switch flipped and I became far more
		interested in baseball than before. I began watching every
		game and logging every game I went to. It all started with a
		spreadsheet, then evolved into a website, then back to a
		spreadsheet, and now back to a website again.</Paragraph>

		<SectionHeader>Games</SectionHeader>

		<Paragraph>As of December 2023, the list of games on the games
		page is likely 100% complete! For many years the oldest game I
		went to was in 2012, but with the help of my dad, I added 4
		more games to it, and based on information he had on games he
		attended, the game in 2007 is likely the first ever Mariners
		game I went to. I've also added filters, which is a first for
		the history of this website; it used to just be one long list.
		If you've come from an earlier version of my site, you'll
		notice this page looks a whole lot different than it did
		before (and hopefully a whole lot better too). Do note that
		the filters aren't 100% perfect; for example, if you set the
		same team as Home and Road, no games will show up since it
		will look for games that have the same team as home and road,
		not one with them as the home or road team. I'll improve the
		logic and presentation over time to make it easier to
		use.</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph>Each game has some surface level information, along
		with a link to the boxscore on Baseball-Reference (for regular
		season and postseason games), and a log for each game,
		including details that may not show up in the boxscore. These
		logs start out pretty barebones, but become increasingly
		detailed over time. I used to include bits in here about the
		parks I was visiting, but those have almost entirely been
		moved into the ballpark review pages. I'm working to clean up
		any remaining bits that have more to do with the park than the
		game.</Paragraph>

		<SectionHeader>Park Reviews</SectionHeader>
		
		<Paragraph>Having been to 14 Major League Baseball stadiums
		and 4 Spring Training stadiums, I wanted to leave my thoughts
		and experiences for others to read. Since the Spring Training
		parks are way smaller in both capacity and size, and are
		frankly far less interesting than the regular season
		equivalents, I've put them in a separate menu from the major
		league parks. If you're coming from an earlier version of my
		website, you'll notice that all the reviews are <i>finally</i> 
		done, the first time I've ever been completely up to date on
		them.</Paragraph>

		<SectionHeader>Other Plans</SectionHeader>

		<Paragraph>I would also like to rank all the ballparks I've
		been to. I have a list in my head and have made notes here an
		there about how one park is better or worse than another, but
		eventually I will compile them onto a page. I will also likely
		change the format of my ballpark reviews, since I feel like
		they don't give as much information on how my opinion was
		formed. Lastly, I will work on maintaining the website and
		improving it, as it's much easier to work with than before.
		Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy your time here
