This was a Turn back the Clock Night to 1906. The Mariners wore
uniforms from the 1906 Seattle Turks team, while the Cubs wore their
1906 uniforms. This was my first interleague game, which was neat.
While the Mariners tied the game in the bottom of the 9th inning, that
was all they could muster as the Cubs came out on top from a go-ahead
home run in the 11th inning by Alfonso Soriano, who would eventually
be traded to the Yankees at the deadline. My dad and I sat in the
upper deck from behind home plate for the first time, which is a spot
I've repeatedly gone back to when I don't want to spend a lot on
tickets but want a good view.
