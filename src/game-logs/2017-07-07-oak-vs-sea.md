For this game, the Mariners were giving away snow globes! You got
either a snow globe of then-Safeco Field, or the old stadium they
played in, the Kingdome. I ended up with Safeco Field, which I still
own.

I've decided that the location of our seats at this game are one of my
favorite in the entire park. We had tickets to sit in the upper deck
behind home plate, which I've done plenty, but we moved to the main
level when we realized the crowd was relatively light.  Overall just a
great night for baseball, one of the better experiences I can
remember, when you combine the seat location, weather, and team
performance.
