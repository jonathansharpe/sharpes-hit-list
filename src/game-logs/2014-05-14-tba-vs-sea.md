This was the only game I attended with my school, at least that I can
remember. Unfortunately, the game was pretty lackluster. However, my
PE teacher's son worked for the Mariners, and was able to get the
Mariner Moose over to our section, and got us some jumbotron airtime!
So that was neat. I also think it was this game where I bought a
souvenir soda cup, one that I used at home until 2021!
