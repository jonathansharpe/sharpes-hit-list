This game had a pregame celebration of Ken Griffey Jr.'s induction to
the National Baseball Hall of Fame, as well as his number 24 being
retired by the Mariners. The excellent ceremony contained a famous
line by Junior, which was "To the guys on my left, keep fighting,
'cause we're all rooting for you."

The game started off rather lackluster, with the Angels taking a 3-0
lead off of Mike Trout's 3-run home run in the first inning. The
Angels continued scoring, and the Mariners were down 6-2 going into
the bottom of the 5th. They scored 2 runs to reach within striking
distance, and in the bottom of the 7th they took the lead off of a
home run from light-hitting shortstop Shawn O'Malley. Edwin Diaz
locked down another save, already his 4th of the week.
