This was the 7th home opener in 8 years, interrupted only by the
COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. I went with my dad and Andrew. Since that
game in 2019 was the day before college classes started, this was the
first game I attended while in college! Capacity was limited to 9000
fans for the first two homestands, and this one was reported as a
sellout. Masks and social distancing will be a thing. 

Mariners were down early, 5-1 after 7 innings. They came back with 6
runs in the bottom of the 8th to take a 7-6 lead, including an error
on a throw by Brandon Belt to Brandon Crawford, two guys who have
played together forever, to give the Mariners the lead. The Giants
came back with a pinch-hit home run by Alex Dickerson in the top of
the 9th. Mariners walked it off in the 10th off of 3 straight walks by
Jose Alvarez, and due to the runner on 2nd thatâ€™s all they needed. The
end was very influenced by both the three batter minimum rule and the
runner on 2nd in extras rule, probably the most I'd seen of any game
since the either rule was instituted. The crowd was great despite
capacity limitations, and since everyone was spread out it was plenty
loud. Another excellent Opening Day for the Mariners.
