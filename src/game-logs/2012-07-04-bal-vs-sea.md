This game was the first I'd been to since 2010. Unfortunately I don't know the details of the games I've been to before 2012 so this is when the records start. Hector Noesi went into this game with a 2-10 record and a 5.69 ERA. That trend continued as he gave up 4 runs in 5 innings, which was enough for an opponent facing the 2012 Mariners. They managed to score 2 in the bottom of the 9th, but Miguel Olivo's flyout to right to end the game was just too short. We sat in the right field seats for the first time.
