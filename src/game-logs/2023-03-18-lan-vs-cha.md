This was the only non-Mariners game we saw on our weekend. We ate a
relatively late breakfast (first trip to Waffle House), and since
spring training food isn't nearly as high quality as what you'll find
in a big league stadium, I decided to purchase peanuts at a baseball
game for the very first time, if you can believe it. I can see why
they're such a classic ballpark snack, as it filled my needs well for
an afternoon at the yard.

In terms of the actual game, there weren't actually too many notable
players playing today. Mookie Betts was still away at the World
Baseball Classic, so the only notable Dodger superstar that actually
played was Freddie Freeman. The White Sox also didn't really have
anyone that jumped off the page for me. Something that lowkey was very
strange was that the White Sox actually lost their DH midway through
the game. I have no idea how this would happen in a spring training
game, when you have all those guys on the bench and are trying to get
as many guys in as possible. The move was Victor Reyes from DH to left
field, and center fielder Jake Marisnick was removed from the game,
presumably due to injury (I'm not sure how I'd look up injury
information for a spring training game). In the end, a good baseball
experience.
