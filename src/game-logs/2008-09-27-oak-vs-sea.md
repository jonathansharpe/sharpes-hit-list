My dad found some old photos of us going to this game as a family.
That makes this the first game we went to as a family, and we only
went to one more as a family, that being Felix Hernandez's perfect
game in 2012.

Like the game in 2009, I have no memory of this one. The only perhaps
noteworthy thing is that it was game 161 of the season, but the
Mariners had already lost their 100th game and were not in playoff
contention whatsoever. While this was evidently the latest game I'd
been to (and likely my second ever), I did eventually attend a game
162 in 2019, also against the A's as it happens.
