Went to this game with my same friends from the Cardinals game the
year before. The Mariners took an early lead and were ahead 3-2 after
2 innings, and 4-2 after 7. Unfortunately, the inconsistent Dan
Altavilla surrendered a game-tying home run to J.D. Martinez. The game
went extras, and the Tigers had lefty Justin Wilson in to face Kyle
Seager. However, despite being a lefty hitter, Seager has hit lefties
quite well, including many home runs off left-handed pitchers. While I
was hoping for that, the Mariners would settle for a double, which
scored pinch-runner Tyler Smith from second. Interestingly, this would
be Tyler Smith's final MLB game, as he must have gotten sent down
shortly thereafter and never cracked a major league roster again.
