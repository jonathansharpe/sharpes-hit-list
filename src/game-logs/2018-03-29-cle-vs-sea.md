We continued the tradition of going to home openers, despite the fact
that I had a choir event that afternoon. This was our 2nd Opening Day,
which in my opinion is always more exciting than just a home opener.
The Mariners faced the Indians again, and though slightly
controversially, Felix Hernandez was given the ball. At this point
James Paxton was clearly the better pitcher, though he didn't start
Opening Day, and never would in a Mariners uniform.

Felix pitched pretty well, allowing no runs over 5.1 innings, his 2nd
shortest Opening Day start; his shortest was the year prior in
Houston, going only 5 innings. The Mariners were facing reigning Cy
Young winner Corey Kluber, who gave up 2 runs in the first inning, and
somehow that's all the Mariners would need, despite Kluber throwing an
8-inning complete game! A good Opening Day win for the Mariners.
