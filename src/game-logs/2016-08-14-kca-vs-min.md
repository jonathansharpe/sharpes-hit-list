This was the fourth stadium I'd visited. I didn't have super high
expectations or anything, but this is a fantastic ballpark. 

The game itself was pretty interesting, since the Royals' center
fielder Paulo Orlando ended up a triple short of the cycle. This was
also during Twins' second baseman Brian Dozier's incredible 2016
second half, and he hit one of his 28 post All-Star Break home runs.
He ended up hitting 42 for the season, setting a new record for a
second baseman in the American League. 

While as a neutral fan, I wanted to see the Twins win (as the home
team), this was still a great experience.
