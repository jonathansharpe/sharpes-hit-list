This was another game with my friend group, our 4th. Mariners showed
no life until the bottom of the 7th, when Tom Murphy hit a game-tying
2 run home run. JP Crawford made an AMAZING play to end the top of the
9th inning. Ryan Court made his MLB debut and lined out. The ball was
hit at 107 MPH, and had a 74% hit probability, making what would have
been an amazing moment a tough luck out. However, Mallex Smith
followed with a base hit to win the game. 

The game was followed by a Hall of Fame-themed fireworks show
celebrating Edgar Martinez's induction to the National Baseball Hall
of Fame. We sat in the left field bleachers for the first time since
Opening Day 2015, and they now had padded backrests! Before, there
were literally just the metal benches to sit on, if I remember
correctly. A good game, and this made it the 3rd walk off in 4 games
I'd seen with this friend group.
