This was a game I went to with my mom, which we didn't do super often
since my dad and I would always go to games together. I was excited to
see the Marlins, because they had slugger Giancarlo Stanton, and while
I obviously wanted the Mariners to win this game, I did want to see
him hit a home run. Fortunately, he did hit a home run, but I missed
it because I was on the concourse looking for food or something. 

Felix started this game, the first time I'd seen him pitch in a little
over two years. He had a rough first inning, but eventually settled
down. Despite giving up four runs and twelve(!) hits, he went 6.1
innings and got the win.

Despite the Mariners scoring 10 runs, none of them came off a home
run. Mitch Haniger continued his excellent hitting, going 3-for-4 with
3 hits, 4 RBI and a walk. Nice win for the team to cap off their first
homestand of the year.
