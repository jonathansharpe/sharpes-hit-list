Hisashi Iwakuma started this game, and was on the ropes in the first.
But then Nelson Cruz of all people made a diving catch in right field
with the bases loaded to get Kuma out of that jam. There wasn't
anything super special about this game, although it was the Saturday
before the All-Star Break. I've been to 3 games in the series before
the All-Star Break; two Fridays, and this Saturday game.
