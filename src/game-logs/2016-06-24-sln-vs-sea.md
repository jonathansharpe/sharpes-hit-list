This game I went to with my friends from my youth group for the first
time. The Mariners needed another starter, and so they acquired Wade
leBlanc from the Blue Jays a couple days before this game. He had an
outstanding start, going 6 shutout innings. The Mariners had a 1-0
lead going into the 8th, but unfortunately that turned into a 3-1
Cardinals lead. In the bottom of the 8th, the Mariners faced Seunghwan
Oh, who looked dominant. However, at this point in the season, Trevor
Rosenthal was still their closer, despite pitching quite poorly to
that point. I was optimistic the Mariners could score off him, and
they certainly did that, with an Adam Lind walk-off 3-run home run. A
really exciting end to the game, after it honestly being quite boring
to that point.
