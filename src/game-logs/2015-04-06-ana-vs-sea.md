This game was the first Opening Day I went to, though my second home
opener. Going into this year, the Mariners were projected to win the
division by multiple sports outlets, though they didn't even come
close to that, finishing in 4th place. In fact, this was the only day
they finished with a record over .500, at 1-0. So, yeah; you can see
how that worked out. New acquisition Seth Smith went 3-for-3 before
being removed for a pinch-hitter, and was tied for the league lead in
average with 1.000. The Mariners gave out these neat K towels, and I
still have mine in a closet somewhere. A pretty fun game, given the
expectations of the team.
