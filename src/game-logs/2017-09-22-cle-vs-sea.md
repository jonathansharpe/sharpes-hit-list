This game is the only game I've been to while being sick; I missed
school due to a cold, but I wasn't going to let that stop me from
going to this game. While the Mariners were basically eliminated from
the postseason race at this point, I was still excited for this game
as it was my first time going to Fan Appreciation Night, which is
always the last Friday game of the year.

The Indians were pretty fresh off their modern record 22-game win
streak, and so this was a tall task for the Mariners. However, Erasmo
Ramirez of all people rose to the occasion, throwing 8 innings of
1-run ball, one of the best outings from a Mariner starting pitcher in
months. Knowing that the Mariners had the top of the lineup coming to
the plate in the bottom of the 9th, I was confident they'd win the
game, and they did! Nelson Cruz hit a walk-off 2-run home run off
Cleveland closer Cody Allen. A good win for the Mariners.
