This game was a good pitching matchup, Felix Hernandez vs Jordan
Zimmermann. Unfortunately, the Mariners ended up on the wrong side of
this one, with Felix giving up 5 runs in 7 innings, while Zimmermann
went 6 innings and only gave up 2 runs. We also had a postgame
fireworks show afterward, the first I had been to.
