This was the first game I got to attend that wasn't in Seattle!! I was
very excited for this one, given the fact that the park was
celebrating its 100th anniversary. While the tarp came out a little
before the start of the game, it ended up starting on time. 

This was an interesting experience because it was the last year of
Wrigley not having any jumbotrons whatsoever, so there was no way to
show instant replay to the crowd at all. I don't remember the game
being super interesting from a neutral fan perspective; it was mostly
about seeing Wrigley Field for the first time.
