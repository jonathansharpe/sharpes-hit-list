The final game of the trip, and 12th overall. I got a hat here, a
California Angels one from ‘72-’92, that cost $50 because it was
fitted! A nice hat though, very comfortable and looks cool.

We sat in the right field seats, which gave us a good view of the game
but had our backs turned to the main scoreboard. Fortunately, the
jumbotron in left was mostly a mirror of whatever was shown behind us.
I went up to the 3rd deck in the later innings to get a picture from
the top-most row behind home plate. We got to see Shohei Ohtani, who
pitched a great game and lead off the game with a double.
Unfortunately that was all he did with the bat, I was hoping for a
home run since we were in prime territory for that. The game was
honestly probably the least interesting from a neutral fan
perspective, but the Blue Jays lost, which was important for the
Mariners. Overall a good end to the parks we visited.
