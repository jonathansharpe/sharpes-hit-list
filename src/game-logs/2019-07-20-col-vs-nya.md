This was the seventh park. This was my 2nd time seeing both Rockies
and Yankees, the latter of which made the list of teams I've seen play
home and away (Royals, Cubs, Twins, Red Sox). 

We sat in our seats in right-center field for about 2 innings, then
got up and walked around because it was 97 degrees and the heat was
unbearable. We walked through Monument Park, which was neat, and we
saw the museum with a bunch of the World Series trophies and history,
which was also neat. I'm overall disappointed with the stadium,
especially compared to what they were basing it after.

There isn't all that much to say about the game itself, as the Yankees
took the lead early and never looked back.
