This was the first home opener I was able to attend. We left right
after school ended, and we ended up being late and missed the pregame
ceremonies! The Mariners hit a little bit, including Corey Hart, who
hit 2 home runs. This would not be indicative of his success, however,
as he only ended up with 6 home runs in the 68 games he played that
year. It was actually a decent idea to sign him, it just didn't work
out at all. 

James Paxton pitched a good game, though left in the 6th inning with
an injury. Little did we know this would be the start of his yearly
injury problems, which still plague him as of 2023. Overall a fun
game, and the beginning of my currently unbroken (only by 2020) streak
of home openers.
