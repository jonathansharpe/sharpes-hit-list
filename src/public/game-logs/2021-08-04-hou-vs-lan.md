This was park #8, and only 2nd in the National League. The crowd for
this game was electric. This was by far the best crowd I'd been a part
of at a baseball game before. There were many chants, including
"Astros Suck", "Cheaters", and "F*ck Correa".

Walking around the park pre-game, I managed to get autographs from
Manny Mota and Steve Yeager, both former Dodgers. Yeager mentioned
that he played in Seattle in his final year, and told me to enjoy my
time in California (spoiler: I did). 

The food selection was off the charts, and while T-Mobile Park might
have more variety, all the options at Dodger Stadium made a lot of
sense for baseball. There were BBQs, Dodger Dogs, garlic fries,
burgers, ice cream, nachos, street tacos, and more. I went with a
Dodger Dog, which were decent, but the fries were good and they had
Coke products. Also got the obligatory soft serve helmet cup. Overall
probably the best experience I've ever had at a baseball game.
