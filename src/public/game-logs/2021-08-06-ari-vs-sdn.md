This is park #9, 3rd in the National League. It was my 2nd time seeing
the Diamondbacks, with the third viewing coming up in a few days.

The Dbacks starter struggled HARD, and was walking everyone. The
Padres scored 5 runs in the 2nd, but that was all they’d get for the
entire game. The Padres gave it back up, and the go-ahead run was
driven in by...the winning pitcher, who was also a reliever!! He also
stole 2nd, which added to the weirdness. The first, and probably the
last time I’ll see a relief pitcher hit the go-ahead RBI in a game. We
sat in the upper deck, which by default were the worst seats we had,
but they weren’t bad or anything. Overall a good experience.
