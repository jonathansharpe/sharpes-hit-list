This game was a last-minute plan. This was the last game of the
season, and my first while living in Seattle! I attend college in the
city, so I was able to make a brief 15-minute drive to the park, vs
the hour-plus it'd usually be. I went to the game with two friends I
had just met, including my friend Andrew. This was obviously our first
game together, but would be far from the last. 

Despite going to many home openers and a few Opening Days to this
point, this was my first time seeing the final game of the season.
After every final home game of the season, the Mariners players stick
around and toss out extra giveaways they had, and they did the same
here. Unfortunately, we didn't get any. Mariners center fielder Kyle
Lewis was taking pictures with fans, and I probably would have gotten
one if he had stuck around a few more minutes. 

Kyle Seager homered, Kyle Lewis got an RBI. Pretty good way to end the
season. This ended up being the last game I went to for 550 days,
because of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in no attendance for
the entire Mariners 2020 season.
