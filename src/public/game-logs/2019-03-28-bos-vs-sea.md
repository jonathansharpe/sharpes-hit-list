This was my 6th straight home opener, and while it wasn't Opening Day
for the Mariners, it was Opening Day for the rest of baseball. The
Mariners broke out the bats! Chris Sale's velocity was down after a
little bit, and he only pitched 3 innings. Tim Beckham hit 2 home
runs; Edwin Encarnacion, Domingo Santana, Ryon Healy also went deep.
Very exciting game, and the most runs the Mariners have scored in a
game I've attended.
