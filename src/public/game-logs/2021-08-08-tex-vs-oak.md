This was 3rd park of the trip, and was #10 overall, meaning I'd now
visited one-third of all Major League Baseball parks. Despite the
coliseum's reputation, it was honestly not as bad as I thought it
would be. 

It was kinda cool being in a "concrete jungle" stadium. The 2nd
concourse was absolutely dead, but the main concourse was poppinâ€™. Our
seats were pretty decent, though they didn't feel as close to the 200
level seats felt in San Francisco, the next game we went to. Overall
decent to good experience, and I would honestly rather go here again
than Yankee Stadium.
