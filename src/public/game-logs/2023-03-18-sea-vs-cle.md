Game number three on our slate for this weekend, this time against the
Guardians in Goodyear. Having just been eliminated from the World
Baseball Classic, Julio Rodriguez was back and starting this game. It
was cool to see his interactions with fans and players, since you're
rarely close enough to see it. Speaking of close, we were maybe 5 rows
behind the Mariners dugout, almost certainly the closest I've been in
a game. The previous closest was probably sitting in Fenway Park,
which was a great spot because of the section configuration. I've also
sat about 10-20 rows behind the Mariners dugout in Seattle, but it's
been a while, and isn't my favorite view anyway.

Luis Castillo was making one of his final tune-ups before Opening Day,
which coincidentally would also be against these Guardians, in
Seattle. Castillo did well, giving up only 3 runs over 4.1 innings.
Unfortunately, the Mariners were down 5-1 going into the 9th inning.
They managed to rally for 3 runs, but failed to push the needle
further as they ultimately lost 5-4. An exciting game at the end.
