This was my sixth park of thirty. It was my first time seeing Blue
Jays in person, which was the final AL East team I hadn't seen in
person. The Red Sox became the 4th team I've seen home and away (Cubs,
Royals, Twins), a list that wouldn't get the Mariners for another four
years. 

There was a serious chance that the game would be postponed, as
thunderstorms were rampant before the game. The start time was delayed
from 7:10 to around 7:45, but the whole game was played with no more
delays. There was some rain during the game, but it wasn't bad. 

We flew in on a red-eye flight the night before, and I was running on
about 2 hours of sleep. I was extremely tired in the 5th or 6th
inning, but was kept awake by some Pepsi. We left in the middle of the
8th inning, after they played Sweet Caroline, a Fenway Park tradition.
As I said before, a fantastic ballpark and a fantastic experience.
