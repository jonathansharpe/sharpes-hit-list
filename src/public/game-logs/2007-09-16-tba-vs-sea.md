Here it is, likely my first ever Mariners game! I actually remember
bits and pieces of this one. As a kid who grew up obsessed with
trains, we took the Sounder Train from Everett to Seattle. I remember
that as much. I believe the roof may have also been closed. We
probably sat in the upper deck, since I don't think I sat in the lower
deck for the first time until 2012. I also remember that since it was
a Sunday, I could have run around the bases if I wanted to, but I
remember declining as that would have meant we'd have to catch a later
train, and I must have been ready to get home.

This will likely be the earliest entry on this site. Based on some
dates of games my dad went to, the only possibility is that we went to
one other game sometime in 2007, but that's unlikely given we'd only
ever gone to, at most, one game a year until 2012. That makes this is
the beginning of my baseball game journey.
