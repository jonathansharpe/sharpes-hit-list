This was home opener #3. The Mariners had a new manager and general
manager at this point, hopefully indicating a better future for the
ball club. While they won the first series of the season in Texas,
they dropped this game. Dae-Ho Lee, the Mariners right-handed part of
first base, got his first major league hit in the form of a home run!
While he wasn't an amazing player, he was a fan favorite here in
Seattle, despite the fact he was only a Mariner, let alone the league,
for one season. The game was close, but Steve Cishek, the Mariners
closer, gave up a home run to Chris Coghlan in the top of the 9th
inning and that won the A's the game.
