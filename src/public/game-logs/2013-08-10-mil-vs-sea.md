This game was supposed to be exciting, since they had a pregame
ceremony celebrating Ken Griffey Jr.'s induction into the Mariners
Hall of Fame. Unfortunately, they just failed to show up in any
capacity. Hisashi Iwakuma had a great outing, up until the 7th where
he just lost it, and Mariners manager Eric Wedge left him in for
probably too long. This is tied for the most lopsided loss I've seen
in person, with a game I saw in 2018 against the Dodgers.
