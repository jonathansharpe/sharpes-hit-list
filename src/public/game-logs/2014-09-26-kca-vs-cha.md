This was the third ever park I'd visited, and definitely less
interesting than Wrigley Field.

Similar to Wrigley, this park had some slightly outdated elements
including a couple large dot-matrix scoreboards. Safeco Field had a
smaller one up through 2012, but each one the White Sox had was bigger
on its own than the one the Mariners had. The video scoreboard was
also much smaller than the one in Seattle, and pretty low-res. Like
Wrigley, it gave a retro vibe to the experience, but from a different
era; Wrigley was more like the 1950s or 60s, with U.S. Cellular more
like 80s and 90s with the dot-matrix scoreboards; I liked it. I took a
walk around the main concourse, which was neat. It was later in the
game, so it was dark and cool, one of my favorite parts of baseball
games; when it has cooled down and the lights are taking full effect.
I also liked the pseudo wall that surrounds the concourse. The White
Sox launch fireworks after each home run, which I thought was neat.
The Mariners now do it as well, but hadn't started it quite yet.

The Royals were in the wild card hunt at this point, and ended up
securing their spot I think the next night. The White Sox were stuck
in their phase of mediocrity, which they wouldn't really leave until
late 2016 and 2017 when the rebuild was a full go.
