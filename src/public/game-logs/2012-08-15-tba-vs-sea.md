This was a game we went to as a family, and would end up being our last. My sister has a peanut allergy, and this was one of the few games that included a peanut-free section, so that's where we sat. Little did we know we'd end up experiencing history that day. 

The first out of the game was a running catch made by right fielder Eric Thames, which proved to be incredibly important. After that Felix just mowed guys down like it was nothing. Once it was the 8th inning, the crowd was into it. Everyone was on every pitch. When Felix got the final out, he made that now iconic pose in his celebration.

This was the only truly dominant performance I ever saw from Felix in-person, other than Opening Day 2015. I saw him again in the next game I went to, once in 2014, and one more time in 2017, but that was in his decline. While I have other games I enjoyed more, being at a perfect game was incredible.
