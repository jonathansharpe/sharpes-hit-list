Our final game of our excursion. We definitely forgot to change the
directions and were en route to Goodyear at first, until I was like
"wait a second" and we corrected our mistake. We got there essentially
right in time for first pitch. 

Notable for this game, Jacob deGrom was making his Cactus League debut
for the Rangers, as he had previously spent his entire career with the
Mets. deGrom pitched well, allowing zero runs over three innings. The
Mariners ended up losing this game as well, 2-1.
