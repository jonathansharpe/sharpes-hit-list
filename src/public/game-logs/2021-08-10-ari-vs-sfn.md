This was the 4th park of the trip, and 11th overall. Like Dodger
Stadium, we managed to secure free tickets for this game as well with
our connections! These seats were right up there with the Dodger
Stadium seats in quality, and they were on the 200 level. It was a
very intimate feel, which was amazing I thought. 

We had some fun beyond center field in a relatively new party deck
area, and the Diamondbacks had batting practice. A relief pitcher,
Bret de Geus was giving kids baseballs, and one kid gave his bracelet
to him as a trade for a ball! Andrew also gave his necklace to him,
which was neat. 

The game was pretty exciting, the Giants took what seemed like a
commanding lead before Alex Wood just absolutely lost it in the 6th
inning after looking nearly unhittable for the first 5 innings. The
Giants took the lead in the 8th, before Jake McGee struggled in the
9th and walked a few guys, which resulted in the Diamondbacks tying
the game. The Giants ended up walking it off, via an error batted by
recent acquisition Kris Bryant! Very exciting game, and the park was
amazing to boot.
