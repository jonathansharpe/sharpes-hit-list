This was Felix Hernandez's third start after the perfect game. While
we had hoped to see some brilliance, unfortunately it was somewhat of
a lackluster performance. While he pitched well most of the day,
Mariners manager Eric Wedge left him out there for the 8th inning,
where he coughed up four runs, putting the Mariners behind 5-2, which
is how the score held the rest of the way.
