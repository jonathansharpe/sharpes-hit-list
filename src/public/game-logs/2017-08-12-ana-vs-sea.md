This was Edgar Martinez number retirement night. The Mariners
scheduled this presumably to add to his Hall of Fame case, despite the
fact that he was obviously deserving of being voted in. The pregame
ceremony was tremendous, but the Mariners performance was not. While
they did have a 3-1 lead, that was not nearly enough for their
questionable bullpen. Pretty disappointing for a game with such a big
crowd. They ended up being swept by the Angels actually, which was
somewhat embarrassing in my opinion.
