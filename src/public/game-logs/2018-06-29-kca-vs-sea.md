Went to this game with the same friend group as the previous two
years. To this point, we had managed to see two walk-off wins, so I
was interested to see if that trend would continue. Mitch Haniger and
Mike Zunino each hit home runs, with Zunino's being an absolute
mammoth shot, about 3 rows from the top row in the upper deck in left.
Marco Gonzales threw an absolute gem, and was a strike away from a
shutout after going 1-2 to Mike Moustakas before giving up an RBI
single. He got the next hitter out and finished the game for his first
MLB complete game. All around a great game for the Mariners.
