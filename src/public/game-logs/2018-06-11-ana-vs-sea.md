This was a fun game, as I went with my dad and some friends. The
Angels took an early 2-0 lead in the top of the first, off home runs
from Mike Trout and Albert Pujols. However, the Mariners answered
right back with a 2-run home run from Nelson Cruz. The Mariners
continued to see Angels starter Andrew Heaney well, as both Cruz and
Ryon Healy tagged him in the bottom of the 4th to end his night. While
Trout did hit a second home run, that wasn't enough as the Mariners
held on and won 5-3. This actually put the Mariners up half a game
above the Astros in the division standings, but that didn't last too
long. A good win for the Mariners.
