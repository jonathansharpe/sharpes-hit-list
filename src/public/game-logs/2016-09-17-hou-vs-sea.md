Like the previous game, the Mariners offense didn't do much. It was a
close pitching matchup between Mike Fiers and James Paxton, but Fiers
ended up on top of this one. This was the ninth game I made it to this
year, and the seventh Mariners game, both personal records, unmatched
for a few seasons.
