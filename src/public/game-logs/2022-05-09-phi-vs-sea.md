I went to this game with some college friends. Chris Flexen gave up a
few runs early on, and ended up yielding six total, which got him
through five innings. However, the Mariners didn't score any runs at
all, meaning Flexen's bad performance didn't have a ton of impact on
the final outcome.

I mean, bad game tbh
