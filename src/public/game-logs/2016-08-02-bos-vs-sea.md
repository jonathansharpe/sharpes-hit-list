The Mariners were facing the division-leading Red Sox, and their ace
David Price. Wade leBlanc also got the start in this game, though
didn't pitch quite as well as before, giving up 3 runs in 6 innings. 

The Mariners found themselves down 4-0 going into the bottom of the
8th, with Price dealing all game. He started the 8th inning, but the
wheels fell off and the Mariners took advantage. Mike Zunino led off
the inning with a home run. Guillermo Heredia, recent Triple-A call-up,
got his first major-league hit and RBI to get the Mariners their
second run. Then a few hitters later, Robinson Cano hit a 3 run BOMB
to our section in right field to give the Mariners a 5-4 lead. In
fact, if you look at video of the home run he hit, you can see my dad
and I in the frame! 

This dramatic comeback was followed with Edwin Diaz, young
flamethrower getting his first career save after being given the
closers job starting that evening. Weirdly enough, the winning pitcher
in this game, reliever Donn Roach, also won the walk-off game in June.
These were the only two wins Roach got that year, and he only pitched
in 4 games with the Mariners. Easily the best game I had been to at
this point in the season.
