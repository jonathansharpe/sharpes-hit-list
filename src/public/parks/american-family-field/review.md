# Intro

With my trip to American Family Field, I have (for a few months) seen half of the active major league baseball stadiums, a huge milestone. My impressions of the former Miller Park was that it was a solid stadium, and my visit confirmed that.

# Exterior
The park is built adjacent to the old site of Milwaukee County Stadium, and it is surrounded by a sea of parking. Many modern stadiums are built right in the city, but since this one was built next to a multipurpose statium, it inherited the decision to build that outside the city. Still, we walked to the park as we were staying in a hotel nearby. The walk was okay, it involved going on an overpass above the nearby highway. With all the parking, you're definitely intended to just drive there, but the walk was fine. There are statues of Robin Yount and Hank Aaron outside the front entrance, which was cool to see.

# Concourses
There are 4 main concourses, levels 100-400. The 300 level is similar to T-Mobile Park's terrace club, and the 200 level is just a higher up version of the 100 level. Every time I visit a new park with a distinct middle deck, it just reinforces my opinion that it provides the best seats in the park. I chose the 200 level, and despite being in the sun, it was a fantastic view. I lament T-Mobile Park's lack of a true 200 level, as the terrace club is just so expensive and does not provide as good of views as other parks I've been to.

The only concourse that encircles the field is the 100 level concourse, which is pretty typical for most stadiums. The concourse felt similar size to T-Mobile Park, but had fewer food stands so it was easier to navigate. There were a few team stores scattered around the park. The main one felt similar in size to T-Mobile Park, but felt more open.

# Field

The foul lines actually have quite deep distances, at 344 feet and 345 feet for the left and right field foul poles respectively. As a result the walls more gradually deepen as you go to center field, which is a typical 400 feet. In right field there is a rather sharp angle backwards going right to left toward the right field power alley, but the left field power alley does not have this.

# Game Experience

The game experience was pretty great. There were some excellent food options. Given that Milwaukee is known for it's beer, I figured I'd get something alcoholic, so I got a spiked lemonade which was solid. I think I got a hot dog but I don't remember (I'm writing this 9 months after). I do know I got some soft serve, which I enjoyed.

# Conclusion 

Overall, American Family Field is a really solid ballpark that provides a great experience. While I'm not sure I'd make the trip to the midwest just for it, Chicago is so close that you can easily visit both stadiums there and Milwaukee. Plus, with the roof you are guaranteed your game will get played.
