# Intro

This was probably the stadium I was least familiar with, as I couldn't
even remember having seen it on TV in the past. This is the shared
home of the Reds and Guardians.

# Exterior

Nothing particularly memorable about the stadium exterior comes to
mind. We entered in from beyond left field, so we didn't get to see
the main entrance.

# Concourses

There is a single deck surrounding the stadium, though there is also a
second deck with the press box and some suites behind home plate.

# Field

Again, nothing unique about the field here. It's symmetrical like the
other spring training fields.

# Game Experience

The game experience was nice. I don't remember anything in particular
standing out.

# Conclusion

This stadium is pretty on-par with Peoria Stadium, except I prefer it
slightly, perhaps due to the palm trees beyond the outfield. But it's
more a matter of preference at that point. Another spring training
ballpark that's perfectly fine to visit and yields a good experience,
but isn't necessarily worth seeking out.
