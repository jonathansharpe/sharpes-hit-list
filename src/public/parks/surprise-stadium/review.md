# Intro

This was the final park we were visiting on our trip. It is home to
the Rangers and Royals.

# Exterior

The exterior is perhaps the most interesting part of the park. It has
some unique older-style roofs, which were pretty neat. Other than that
there wasn't much else, though this is already more talk than a couple
other parks got.

# Concourses

The park continues the spring training trend of having a single deck
all around, but has probably the most prominent second deck of the
four we visited. I went up there to take some pictures on the third
base side, but upon asking about trying to walk onto the first base
side, I was told I couldn't and it appeared it was either a private
party, or you just needed authorization in general.

# Field

Another symmetrical spring training field; stop me if you've heard
this before.

# Game Experience

Another solid game experience. I remember standing in line for
soft-serve ice cream for a while, that wasn't super fun but it
happens.

# Conclusion

Another pretty standard spring training park. The architecture at
least is a little interesting, and while it may seem like an extremely
small detail, that's kinda what it comes down to with the spring
training parks to differentiate them. Another park that's perfectly
fine but isn't necessarily worth seeking out.
