# Intro
Guaranteed Rate Field, then named U.S. Cellular Field, is the home park of the Chicago White Sox and has been since 1991. It replaced the south side equivalent of Wrigley Field, which sadly was not preserved like it's north side counterpart. It also opened in a really unfortunate time, as it was literally just one season before Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened, and started the retro ballpark trend around Major League Baseball. That being said, the White Sox have made some improvements to Guaranteed Rate Field to try and make it feel old-style, some of which are better than others.

Also, apologies for the terrible photo quality in the header. The picture was taken with an iPhone 4 back in 2014, and all future images are of much higher quality.

# Exterior
The exterior of the park had "U.S. Cellular Field" engraved to some sort of stone or concrete at one of the gates, and likely several others. Based on a couple Google street view images, it appears they have since been replaced with "HOME OF THE CHICAGO WHITE SOX", which I think looks better, though it's odd that Guaranteed Rate wouldn't want to plaster their brand for everyone to see. When the name change was first announced, a lot of people online said that it was the new worst ballpark name in the majors, and I think I would agree with them. Other recent changes for the worse include Miller Park to American Family Field, and Marlins Park to loanDepot Park, though Guaranteed Rate Field probably rolls off the tongue the worst. There is a building that links up to the first base side of the ballpark, that I think follows the shape of the original Comiskey Park. There is also a painted spot in the parking lot nearby that represents the home plate of the original Comiskey Park, though I didn't visit it for some reason when I went back in 2014.

# Concourses
The concourses here reminded me much more of T-Mobile Park rather than Wrigley Field, as all the rows are below the concourse, and you walk down to your seat no matter where you are on the 100 level. I also wanted to go up to the upper deck to take a top down photo, and it was called the 500 deck for some reason; T-Mobile Park's counterpart is the 300 level. It appears there are two levels of suites, and another level of some terrace level of some sort. If I go back, I may have to sit in those terrace seats, as I really like the view and experience you get there. In most cases, it's the perfect balance of view and closeness to the field. Regarding the 500 level, the White Sox actually removed several of the back rows in the early 2000s, to try and give the park a more intimate feel. This was a good move, as those seats are already quite high up.

Unlike Wrigley but like T-Mobile Park, you can do a complete loop around the 100 level, which I remember doing at some point during the game. There is no upper deck beyond the outfield walls, unlike the original Comiskey Park, but I think it works quite well. There is some "steel framework" that surrounds the edge of the concourse, which holds many scoreboards and video boards the park possesses. Looking at old photos, this framework was painted white on the park's opening, and the outfield walls were painted blue! Now, the framework is painted dark grey, and the outfield walls were redone to feature historic White Sox players on a black background. It's amazing how much of a difference this color swap makes. The framework is neat, and while it could seem like it cuts off the park from the outside, it's not a solid wall, so it's open enough that you don't feel confined, but it still clearly defines where the park ends.

# Field
As mentioned before, the outfield walls were repainted at one point. The bullpens were never on the field, but were moved once during the parks history. The outfield walls were also brought in before the 2004 season, but the field is mostly symmetrical, and while the dimensions are different, the old Comiskey Park also had symmetrical dimensions. In general though, the field is mostly uninteresting, and pretty standard.

# Game Experience
Regarding the video boards, at this point the White Sox were slightly behind T-Mobile Park in that department. Prior to the 2013 season, the Mariners converted their entire scoreboard real estate in center field into a giant HD video board, where only a portion of it had been video before. Guaranteed Rate had a couple video boards; one straight away center field, and another beyond right field, which served as the out-of-town scoreboard. There were also a couple of old-school dot-matrix scoreboards, which were actually pretty neat! I'm guessing those had been there since the park's opening, but I really liked these for some reason. Maybe the simplicity of them and the slightly 80s feel is what got me. However, these have understandably since been replaced, and I don't think any parks in MLB still have a dot matrix scoreboard of any kind. They shoot off fireworks for each White Sox home run, which is always a neat touch.

# Conclusion
The game experience was solid, though less so than Wrigley Field, and also worse than T-Mobile Park, basically by default. While it was the worst stadium (also by default) I'd been to at that point, I absolutely would not rank it the worst anymore, which is probably not a surprise, as I went to the Oakland Coliseum in 2021. While it will likely forever be second place in Chicago, it is still a solid ballpark that I would recommend checking out if you're in town and have time to spare after checking out Wrigley.
