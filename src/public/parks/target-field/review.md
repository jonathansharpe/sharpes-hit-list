# Intro
Target Field was the fourth ever park I visited. The trip came to be because of some travel for my dad's job. While the work was literally at the southernmost part of South Dakota, we made a baseball trip out of it anyway. Having watched plenty of Mariners games on TV in Target Field, it never stood out to me as an amazing park or anything. I didn't think it looked bad or anything, but just boring or uninspiring. Well let me tell you, I could not have been more wrong in that regard. I <i>loved</i> Target Field, and it still ranks among my top parks.

# Exterior
Target Field is perhaps the only modern stadium that was built with significant restraints from the city grid. While plenty of modern stadiums today have returned to the city, the Twins had to get creative with their situation. Building the park even necessitated moving a highway underneath it. The Twins were coming from the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which, while giving a tremendous home field advantage, was probably one of the worst parks in its time. While most park gates are numbered or named off location, like the "Left Field Gate" or "Gate 3", the Twins named the Target Field gates from their retired numbers, which I think is pretty neat. We entered the gate nearest to right field, which is at street level. The playing field is actually below street level, which I don't believe is super common. I don't think we walked around much outside the park, but it looks very nice.

# Concourses
Being a decade newer, there were some notable differences from T-Mobile Park. The concourses were <i>extremely</i> wide, wider than any of the three parks I'd seen before. This made it much easier for the vendors in carts to set themselves up, while still leaving plenty of room for the fans to mill about. Unlike many stadiums, the park is more or less completely enclosed on all three decks. This allowed me to take a picture from straight away center field in the upper deck. Also, the park manages to really not feel that enclosed at all. As expected due to the smaller footprint, it has quite an intimate feel, more so than other parks I've been to before or since. The only close comparison may be Fenway Park, which is expected.
# Field
The field is nothing groundbreaking, but one notable feature is the overhang in right field. This allows balls to be "caught" by the stands instead of the right fielder. Off the top of my head, only the Polo Grounds in New York, and Tiger Stadium in Detroit had overhangs in the outfield, making this the only current ballpark to have one.
# Game Experience
The game experience was quite fun. While the Twins were pretty bad in 2016, there was a decently-sized crowd on hand. Another thing that was really unexpected for me was the presence of a real organ. It was used extensively throughout the game, including playing it before the game started. While the Mariners have some solid tunes playing before games in Seattle, there's truly something special about hearing an organ before a baseball game, which I had only experienced once prior to Target Field, in Wrigley. I'm not sure an organ makes sense for every team, but they really are special when done right, and the Twins certainly is.

# Conclusion
Overall, Target Field is a really solid baseball stadium. While it's not super close to any other MLB park, it's absolutely worth visiting I'd say. It's a great blend of the old and new, way more than I expected. You get the old with the confined, intimate feel and the organ, but the new from the wide concourses and other modern amenities. Despite all this, one potential flaw is the fact that it wasn't built with a roof. I'm not sure what it would look like if they were to add one sometime in the future, but I hope that Target Field lasts for decades, because it truly feels like a hidden gem of a park.
