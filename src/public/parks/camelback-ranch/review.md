# Intro

This was the second game of our spring training trip, and it was the
real standout for me among the four we visited. Home of the Dodgers
and White Sox, it's a very nice experience.

# Exterior

To get into the park from where we parked, you walk along a path from
the parking lot that takes you through some trees, by some practice
fields and around a body of water into the stadium; it was very
relaxing. There were also giant Dodgers and White Sox logos, and I got
a picture of myself in front of the Dodgers one. There are plaques and
such that commemorate the Dodger and White Sox All-Stars.

# Concourses

This stadium also has largely one deck, though there are some suites
and a few extra seats behind home plate that form a second deck. Also,
on the third base side where we sat, there was a roof since it faces
the west. While it was quite hot before the game began, it cooled off
as the afternoon went on and the sun was blocked by the roof.

# Field

The field looks pretty symmetrical, just like Peoria Stadium. Really
nothing worth noting here.

# Game Experience

The game experience was pretty good. There were a good amount of
Dodger fans present, understandable given the relatively short travel
for their fans compared to others. The concession choices also seemed
decent enough.

# Conclusion

As mentioned in the intro, this was my favorite of the four spring
training parks I visited. The walk around the facility up to the park
was really neat, and reminded me of something that would exist in a
regular season stadium. If you're looking for other spring training
stadiums to visit, I highly recommend this one.
