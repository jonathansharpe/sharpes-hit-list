# About

Here's the source code for Sharpe's Hit List. I have the games stored
in a MongoDB database, which are fetched with async/await inside
JavaScript; ReactJS to be precise. The pages are built with ReactJS
and run with Vite as a frontend. I also use TailwindCSS for the
styling to make my life easier.
