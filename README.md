# My Baseball Website

This is a repository for my baseball website, which currently is a database of all the baseball games I've attended in person. While a couple pages are finished, the site as a whole is still in development, and I'm interested to see what other content I can add to improve the site. It is written in HTML and CSS, with Bootstrap as a framework. I also use JavaScript for generating the list of games for example.

## Pages
### Main Page

The main page is currently unfinished. I'm unsure what content will be here, but I might start posting blog-like updates there. It's still to be determined.

### Games Attended

This is the page with all the data. There are collapsible lists of each year, housing the games I've gone to. Each game has the final score, a picture representing the location, and a link to the boxscore on baseball-reference.com. There's also a slide-out panel with some game notes. These detail the experience, along with any significant happenings at that game. You may notice the game notes get more detailed as time goes on, mostly because I became more attentive to each game, and my local team, the Seattle Mariners, became more interesting to watch.

### Teams Seen

This page puts the teams in a nicely organized list, with dropdown lists showing what games I've been to involving that team. One goal is to see all 30 MLB teams, which seems very doable, as I'm now only missing 5, all in the National League.

### Sections Sat In/Tier List

These pages are both included in the navbar, but currently do not exist. The former will include a list of where my seats were located for every game, or rough location if I don't have the exact information. The latter will have a tier list of all the ballparks I've been to, which is up to 13 out of 30.

## Future Plans

I'm planning on optimizing the site so it makes more sense from a programming point of view, as well as finishing pages that I'm planning and creating brand new ones.

## Where's the Link?

[Right here!](https://jonathansharpe.github.io/baseball-website/) It's currently hosted on Heroku.

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the site!
